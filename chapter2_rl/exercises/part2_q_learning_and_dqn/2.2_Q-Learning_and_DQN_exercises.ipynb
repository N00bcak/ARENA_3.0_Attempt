    "### Recap of `gym.Env`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a speed recap of the key features the `gym.Env` class provides, and see how we can use it to wrap our gridworld environment from last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `step` method\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment's `step` method takes the action selected by the agent and returns four values: `obs`, `reward`, `done`, and the `info` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "`obs` and `reward` is the next observation and reward that the agent receives based on the action chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "`done` indicates if the environment has entered a terminal state and ended. Here, both the goal-states (+1 and -1) are terminal. Early termination is equivalent to an infinite trajectory where the agent remains trapped for all future states, and always receives reward zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "`info` can contain anything extra that doesn't fit into the uniform interface - it's up to the environment what to put into it. A good use of this is for debugging information that the agent isn't \"supposed\" to see, like the dynamics of the environment. Agents that cheat and peek at `info` are helpful because we know that they should obtain the maximum possible rewards; if they aren't, then there's a bug. We will throw the entire underlying environment into `info`, from which an agent could cheat by peeking at the values for `T` and `R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `render` method\n",
    "\n",
    "Render is only used for debugging or entertainment, and what it does is up to the environment. It might render a little popup window showing the Atari game, or it might give you a RGB image tensor, or just some ASCII text describing what's happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminology note - observation vs. state\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the word *observation* here as some environments are *partially observable*, the agent receives not an exact description of the state they are in, but merely an observation giving a partial description (for our gridworld, it could be a description of which cells directly adjacent to the agent are free to move into, rather than precisely which state they are in). This means that the agent would be unable to distinguish the cell north of the wall from the cell south of the wall. Returning the state as the observation is a special case, and we will often refer to one or the other as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observation and Action Types\n",
    "\n",
    "A `gym.Env` is a generic type: both the type of the observations and the type of the actions depends on the specifics of the environment. Right now, we're only dealing with the simplest case: a discrete set of actions which are the same in every state. In general, the actions could be continuous, or depend on the state. We're also just dealing with a single discrete observation here, although later we'll be taking arrays as our observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we define a class that allows us to use our old environment definition from yesterday, and wrap it in a `gym.Env` instance so we can learn from experience instead. This is very similar to our `MultiArmedBandit` class from last week, but more general. Read the code below carefully and make sure you understand how the Gym environment API works."

You can see from looking at the `step` method above that without this, the agent might keep playing forever, because it always returns `terminated=truncated=False`. The time limit is also an essential part of the problem definition: if it were larger or shorter, there would be more or less time to explore, which means that different algorithms (or at least different hyperparameters) would then have improved performance.\n",

    "Below, you should implement the cheater agent. Last time we only implemented cheater for the multi-armed bandit problem, but here we're implementing a more general version. Recall that at the end of yesterday's exercises we wrote the function `find_optimal_policy` to find the optimal policy for any environment and value of gamma. You should use this function to define the optimal policy on initialization, and then fill in the `get_action` method so that it always returns the corresponding optimal action.\n",

    "Once you've done this, run the code below to check that your cheating agent outperforms the random agent. The cheating agent represents the best possible behavior, as it omnisciently always knows to play optimally.\n",

    "On the environment `ToyGym-v0`, (assuming $\\gamma = 0.99$ and that the environment terminates after 2 timesteps) the cheating agent should always get reward $2 \\gamma = 1.98$,\n",

    "Lastly, methods to learn the Q-value often have trouble exploring. If a state-action pair $(s,a)$ with low Q-value $Q^*(s,a)$ just so happens to return a high reward by chance, the greedy policy with respect to $Q$ will often choose action $a$ in state $s$ instead of exploring potentially other good actions first. To remedy this, we use instead an $\\epsilon$-greedy policy with respect to the current Q-value estimates: With probability $\\epsilon$, a random action is chosen, and with probability $1-\\epsilon$ the greedy action $\\text{argmax}_a Q(s,a)$ is chosen. The exploration probability $\\epsilon$ is a hyperparameter that for now we will set to a constant $\\epsilon = 0.1$, but more sophisticated techniques include the use of a schedule to start exploring often early, and then decay exploration as times goes on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have the choice of how the estimate $Q(s,a)$ is initialized. By choosing \"optimistic\" values (initial values that are much higher than what we expect $Q^*(s,a)$ to actually be), this will encourage the greedy policy to hop between different actions in each state when they discover they weren't as valuable as first thought."

    "Don't worry if you don't fully understand this, the order of operations for these 2 algorithms can get a bit messy. All you really need to understand is this: in both cases, the code variables `exp.obs, exp.act, exp.reward, exp.new_obs` in the observe methods correspond to the pseudocode variables $S, A, R, S'$, and in the case of SARSA we also have `exp.new_action` which corresponds to $A'$.\n",

    "- Use `self.rng.random()` to generate random numbers in the range $[0,1)$, and `self.rng.integers(0, n)` for random integers in the range $0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$.\n",
    "- The random agent results in very long episodes, which slows evaluation. You can remove them from the experiment once you've convinced yourself that your agents are doing something intelligent and outperforming a random agent.\n",
    "- Leave $\\gamma =0.99$ for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the code below, you should expect to see SARSA outperform  Q-Learning (by a lot at first, then this gap will narrow). They should both be slightly worse than the cheater, and *much* better than the random agent."

    "## Tabular Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods used here are called tabular methods, because they create a lookup table from `(state, action)` to the Q value. This is pure memorization, and if our reward function was sampled from the space of all functions, this is usually the best you can do because there's no structure that you can exploit to do better.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can hope to do better on most \"natural\" reward functions that do have structure. For example in a game of poker, there is structure in both of the actions (betting £100 will have a similar reward to betting £99 or £101), and between states (having a pair of threes in your hand is similar to having a pair of twos or fours). We need to take advantage of this, otherwise there are just too many states and actions to have any hope of training an agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "One idea is to use domain knowledge to hand-code a function that \"buckets\" states or actions into a smaller number of equivalence classes and use those as the states and actions in a smaller version of the problem (see Sutton and Barto, Section 9.5). This was one component in the RL agent [Libratus: The Superhuman AI for No-Limit Poker](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~noamb/papers/17-IJCAI-Libratus.pdf). The details are beyond the scope of today's material, but I found them fascinating.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have domain knowledge to leverage, or you care specifically about making your algorithm \"general\", you can follow the approach that we'll be using in the second half of today's exercises: make a neural network that takes in a state (technically, an observation) and outputs a value for each action. We then train the neural network using environmental interaction as training data."

    "### Conceptual overview of DQN\n",
    "\n",
    "DQN is the natural extension of Q-Learning into the domain of deep learning. The main difference is that, instead of a table to store all the Q-values for each state-action pair, we train a neural network to learn this function for us. The usual implementation (which we'll use here) is for the Q-network to take the state as input, and output a vector of Q-values for each action, i.e. we're learning the function:\n",

    "s \\to (Q(s, a_1), ..., Q(s, a_n))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an algorithm showing the conceptual overview of DQN. We cycle through the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate a batch of experiences using our current policy, by **epsilon-greedy sampling** (i.e. we mostly take the action with the highest Q-value, but occasionally take a random action to encourage exploration). Store these experiences in the **replay buffer**.\n",
    "* Use these values to calculate a **TD (temporal difference) error**, and update our network.\n",
    "    * To increase stability, we also have a **target network** we use for the \"next step\" part of the TD error. This is a lagged copy of the Q-network (i.e. we update our Q-network via gradient descent, and then every so often we copy the Q-network weights over to our target network).\n",
    "* Repeat this until convergence.\n",

Use Left/Right arrow keys to move the cart, R to reset, and Q to quit. By default, the cart will alternate Left/Right actions (there's no no-op action) if you're not pressing a button. Use F/S to make the simulation faster/slower. Unlike the real CartPole environment, this simulation will not terminate the episode if the pole falls over.\n",

The network has to learn in which direction to bump the cart in response to the current state of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each environment can have different versions registered to it. By consulting [the Gym source](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/v0.29.0/gymnasium/envs/__init__.py) you can see that CartPole-v0 and CartPole-v1 are the same environment, except that v1 has longer episodes. Again, a minor change like this can affect what algorithms score well; an agent might consistently survive for 200 steps in an unstable fashion that means it would fall over if ran for 500 steps."

    "## Replay Buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of DQN is to reduce the reinforcement learning problem to a supervised learning problem. In supervised learning, training examples should be drawn **i.i.d**. from some distribution, and we hope to generalize to future examples from that distribution. Obviously perfect i.i.d. sampling isn't attainable, but we can approximate this by filling a buffer of past experiences and sampling from it. Note that for very complex problems we may need a very large buffer, because we want the policy to get a representative sample of all the diverse scenarios that can happen in the environment. [OpenAI Five](https://cdn.openai.com/dota-2.pdf) used batch sizes of over 2 million experiences for Dota 2! However we'll be working with the fairly simple CartPole environment, and so we can get away with a much smaller buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL, the distribution of experiences $e_t = (s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ to train from depend on the policy $\\pi$ followed, which depends on the current state of the Q-value network, so DQN is always chasing a moving target. This is why the training loss curve isn't going to have a nice steady decrease like in supervised learning. We will extend experiences to $e_t = (s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1}, d_{t+1})$. Here, $d_{t+1}$ is a boolean indicating that $s_{t+1}$ is a terminal observation, and that no further interaction happened beyond $s_{t+1}$ in the episode from which it was generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination vs Truncation\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we take $d_{t+1}$ to be `terminated`, not `done = terminated | truncated`. The reason is as follows: our time limit was imposed for practical reasons to help with learning, but if the agent views the environment timing out as a form of failure that terminates its reward then it would have no reason to prefer the behaviour \"stay perfectly level\" to the behaviour \"stay level for the first 499 timesteps then immediately fall over\"! We want to encourage the agent to perform well all the time, not just perform well until the environment times out. See [this page](https://farama.org/Gymnasium-Terminated-Truncated-Step-API#theory) for more discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ReplayBuffer` and `ReplayBufferSamples`\n",

    "We've given you 2 classes below. The first, `ReplayBuffer`, holds data from past experiences and also contains methods for sampling that data (the samples are instances of `ReplayBufferSamples`).\n",

    "You should read these implementations carefully, making sure you understand how they work. A few things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `add` method adds multiple experiences at once: the tensors like `obs` have shape `(num_envs, *obs_shape)`. This is because we're using the `SyncVectorEnv` class which allows us to step through & generate experiences for multiple environments simultaneously. We'll see how this works in practice later.\n",
    "- The `add` method will add these experiences to the end of the buffer, slicing the buffer if it's too long. Note that the slicing is done so that we remove the oldest experiences when the buffer is full.\n",

    "Next, you can run the following code to visualize your cart's position and angle, and see how these look in both the buffer and the buffer's random samples. Do the samples look correctly shuffled? Also, based on the [CartPole source code](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/v0.29.0/gymnasium/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py), do the angles & positions at which the cart terminates make sense? points look like they make sense? (Note, the min/max values in the table are different to the termination ranges, the latter can be found *below* the table in the docstring.)\n",

    "Note that the code below uses the `SyncVectorEnv` class, which is what lets us step through multiple environments at once. We create it by passing it a list of functions which can be called to create environments (see the `make_env` function in `utils.py` for exactly how this works). Note that in this case we're just passing it a single environment; tomorrow we'll actually make full use of `SyncVectorEnv` by giving it multiple environments.\n",

The reason for this is as follows: the first time we call `envs.step` after terminating, it'll actually reset the environment rather than taking a step in it (see source code [here](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/v1.0.0/gymnasium/vector/sync_vector_env.py#L209)). In other words, `obs` would be an out-of-bounds terminated state and `next_obs` would be a reset state. We don't want to add this experience to the buffer, because we don't want to teach our model that it can start from an out-of-bounds state and move to a reset state! You can see this reflected in the plots below - the vertical grey lines indicate values $t$ where $d_{t+1} = 1$, and we can see that immediately after this line both $s_t$ and $s_{t+1}$ reset to a new episode, without there being any intermediate logged state where $s_t$ refers to the old episode and $s_{t+1}$ to the new one. \n",

The vertical lines show the values of $t$ where $d_{t+1} = 1$, so we can see that at these points $s_t$ and $s_{t+1}$ both refer to the terminated episode (they're the pre-final and final observations respectively), but immediately after these points $s_t$ refers to the terminal observation while $s_{t+1}$ refers to the first observation of the new episode. This isn't really a problem though, because we don't care what action our agent learns to take when $s_t$ is a terminal state (i.e. out of bounds). If we were being careful then we'd want to filter these terms out of our buffer, but for our purposes this week it doesn't really matter if we keep them in. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, note how when we terminate environments we do something slightly different. If `envs.step` results in some environments terminating, it'll actually return `next_obs` as the observation for the next environment. In this case, we want to use this as our starting observation for the next step, but we need to make sure we record the correct terminal observation in our buffer - we do this by extracting it from the `infos` dict, which is where it gets stored. You can see this in the plots below: the vertical lines are the values $t$ where $d_{t+1}=1$ i.e. $s_{t+1}$ is terminal, and we can see that $s_t, s_{t+1}$ both refer to the terminated episode at this point and both refer to the new episode immediately after."

    "## Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "DQN makes no attempt to explore intelligently. The exploration strategy is the same as\n",
    "for Q-Learning: agents take a random action with probability epsilon, but now we gradually\n",
    "decrease epsilon. The Q-network is also randomly initialized (rather than initialized with zeros),\n",
    "so its predictions of what is the best action to take are also pretty random to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some games like [Montezuma's Revenge](https://paperswithcode.com/task/montezumas-revenge) have sparse rewards that require more advanced exploration methods to obtain. The player is required to collect specific keys to unlock specific doors, but unlike humans, DQN has no prior knowledge about what a key or a door is, and it turns out that bumbling around randomly has too low of a probability of correctly matching a key to its door. Even if the agent does manage to do this, the long separation between finding the key and going to the door makes it hard to learn that picking the key up was important.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, DQN scored an embarrassing 0% of average human performance on this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reward Shaping\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution to sparse rewards is to use human knowledge to define auxillary reward functions that are more dense and made the problem easier (in exchange for leaking in side knowledge and making\n",
    "the algorithm more specific to the problem at hand). What could possibly go wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical example is for a game called [CoastRunners](https://openai.com/blog/faulty-reward-functions/), where the goal was given to maximize the\n",
    "score (hoping that the agent would learn to race around the map). Instead, it found it could\n",
    "gain more score by driving in a loop picking up power-ups just as they respawn, crashing and\n",
    "setting the boat alight in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reward Hacking\n",
    "\n",
    "For Montezuma's Revenge, the reward was shaped by giving a small reward for\n",
    "picking up the key.\n",
    "One time this was tried, the reward was given slightly too early and the agent learned it could go close to the key without quite picking it up, obtain the auxillary reward, and then back up and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Montezuma Reward Hacking](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_sFp1ffKIc8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sFp1ffKIc8 \"Montezuma Reward Hacking\")\n",
    "\n",
    "A collected list of examples of Reward Hacking can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be better if the agent didn't require these auxillary rewards to be hardcoded by humans,\n",
    "but instead reply on other signals from the environment that a state might be worth exploring. One idea is that a state which is \"surprising\" or \"novel\" (according to the agent's current belief\n",
    "of how the environment works) in some sense might be valuable. Designing an agent to be\n",
    "innately curious presents a potential solution to exploration, as the agent will focus exploration\n",
    "in areas it is unfamiliar with. In 2018, OpenAI released [Random Network Distillation](https://openai.com/blog/reinforcement-learning-with-prediction-based-rewards/) which made progress in formalizing this notion, by measuring the agent's ability to predict the output of a neural network\n",
    "on visited states. States that are hard to predict are poorly explored, and thus highly rewarded.\n",
    "In 2019, an excellent paper [First return, then explore](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12919v6.pdf) found an even better approach. Such reward shaping can also be gamed, leading to the\n",
    "noisy TV problem, where agents that seek novelty become entranced by a source of randomness in the\n",
    "environment (like a analog TV out of tune displaying white noise), and ignore everything else\n",
    "in the environment."

    "In DQN, the policy is implicitly defined by the Q-network: we take the action with the maximum predicted reward. This gives a bias towards optimism. By estimating the maximum of a set of values $v_1, \\ldots, v_n$ using the maximum of some noisy estimates $\\hat{v}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{v}_n$ with $\\hat{v}_i \\approx v$, we get unlucky and get very large positive noise on some samples, which the maximum then chooses. Hence, the agent will choose actions that the Q-network is overly optimistic about.\n",

    "## Main DQN Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We now combine all the elements we have designed thus far into the final DQN algorithm. Here, we assume the environment returns three parameters $(s_{new}, r, d)$, a new state $s_{new}$, a reward $r$ and a boolean $d$ indicating whether interaction has terminated yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Q-value function $Q(s,a)$ is now a network $Q(s,a ; \\theta)$ parameterised by weights $\\theta$. The key idea, as in Q-learning, is to ensure the Q-value function satisfies the optimal Bellman equation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q(s,a ; \\theta)\n",
    "= \\mathbb{E}_{s',r \\sim p(\\cdot \\mid s,a)} \\left[r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a' ;\\theta) \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which means the expected TD error will be zero (where expectation here is taken over randomly sampled trajectories):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E} \\left[ r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t) \\right] = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Note that we also have to deal with the case where the episode terminates: i.e. $s_{t+1}$ is a terminal state, and $d_{t+1} = 1$. Since the Q-value of a terminal state is always zero, we can just rewrite the expected TD error expression as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E} \\left[ r_{t+1} + (1 - d_{t+1}) \\, \\gamma \\max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t) \\right] = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "since this makes sure the term is zero whenever $d_{t+1} = 1$. We can now see again why we used `terminated` not `terminated | truncated` here - we don't want the agent to learn that its value is always zero just before the episode terminates and so there's no point in continuing to perform well!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have an expression which should be zero in expectation for our true Q-value function, and we want the model to learn from a variety of experiences at once, we can sample batches of experiences $B = \\{s_{t_i}, a_{t_i}, r_{t_i+1}, d_{t_i+1}, s_{t_i+1}\\}_{i=1}^{|B|}$ from the replay buffer, and train against the loss function which equals the **squared temporal difference error**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{|B|} \\sum_{i=1}^B \\left( r_{t_i+1} + (1 - d_{t_i+1}) \\gamma \\max_a Q(s_{t_i+1}, a ; \\theta_\\text{target}) - Q(s_{t_i}, a_{t_i} ; \\theta) \\right)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here, $\\theta_\\text{target}$ is a previous copy of the parameters $\\theta$, so we're updating our $s_t$ estimates to catch up with our $s_{t+1}$ estimates (just like in standard Q-learning from earlier!). Every so often, we then update the target $\\theta_\\text{target} \\leftarrow \\theta$ as the agent improves it's Q-values from experience.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Logging to `wandb` in RL\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous exercises in this chapter, we've just trained the agent, and then plotted the reward per episode after training. For small toy examples that train in a few seconds this is fine, but for longer runs we'd like to watch the run live and make sure the agent is doing something interesting (especially if we were planning to run the model overnight). Luckily, **Weights and Biases** has got us covered! When you run your experiments, you'll be able to view not only *live plots* of the loss and average reward per episode while the agent is training - you can also log and view animations, which visualise your agent's progress in real time! The code below will handle all logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, effective logging & debugging in RL isn't just about watching videos, since in the vast majority of cases where your algorithm has a bug, the agent will just fail to learn anything useful and the videos won't be informative. Debugging RL requires knowing what variables to log and how to interpret the results you're getting, which requires some understanding of the underlying theory! This is part of the reason why we've spent so much time discussing the theory behind DQN and other RL algorithms, rather than just giving you a black box to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how logged variables can be misleading and hard to interpret, consider our TD loss function in DQN. This loss function just reflects how close together the Q-network's estimates are to the experiences currently sampled from the replay buffer, which might not adequately represent what the world actually looks like. This means that once the agent starts to learn something and do better at the problem, it's expected for the loss to increase. For example, maybe the Q-network initially learned some state was bad, because an agent that reached them was just flapping around randomly and died shortly after. But now it's getting evidence that the same state is good, now that the agent that reached the state has a better idea what to do next. A higher loss is thus actually a good sign that something is happening (the agent hasn't stagnated), but it's not clear if it's learning anything useful without also checking how the total reward per episode has changed. Key point - **just looking at one variable can be misleading, we need to log multiple variables and derive a picture of what's happening from taking all of them into account!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful variables to log during DQN training are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- TD loss, i.e. the actual loss you're backpropagating through. This should start off high and decrease pretty quickly, but may not be monotonic (i.e. temporary spikes in loss aren't necessarily a bad thing)\n",
    "- SPS (steps per second), i.e. the total number of agent steps divided by the total time. This helps us debug when the environment steps are a bottleneck (won't be the case in a simple environment like this one, but might matter more when we move to more complex environments)\n",
    "- Q-values, i.e. the predicted Q-values from the Q-network. Can you guess how these should behave?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Question - what do you think the Q values will do when the agent moves closer to solving the cartpole environment?</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially they should be near zero, thanks to the randomly initialized model weights. As our episode length get closer to 500 (i.e. we can essentially solve the environment), they should tend to the limit of the total possible time-discounted reward available, which is the geometric sum $1 + \\gamma + \\gamma^2 + \\cdots$ (since we get 1 reward for every second we stand up, and as previously discussed, the way we handle `dones` in the formula above doesn't assume a truncated environment causes future rewards to be terminated). The limit of this sum is $\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$, which for our default value $\\gamma = 0.99$ is approximately 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the Q values won't increase smoothly, they'll spike up immediately after we copy over the weights from our Q-network to our target network. This is because each time we copy over weights, our gradient changes and the Q-network rapidly \"catches up\" to this new target network, causing the Q values to change rapidly. However, our copying over of weights will be frequent enough that these jumps will be relatively small, and so the curve should still appear smooth.\n",

See the [documentation page](https://gymnasium.farama.org/v0.29.0/_modules/gymnasium/wrappers/record_episode_statistics/) for an explanation.\n",

    "    - Mean TD loss, Q values, and the epsilon hyperparameter are all useful to log\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't be discouraged if your code takes a while to work - it's normal for debugging RL to take longer than you would expect. Add asserts or your own tests, implement an appropriate probe environment, try anything in the Andy Jones post that sounds promising, and try to notice confusion. Reinforcement Learning is often so tricky as even if the algorithm has bugs, the agent might still learn something useful regardless (albeit maybe not as well), or even if everything is correct, the agent might just fail to learn anything useful (like how DQN failed to do anything on Montezuma's Revenge.)\n",
    "\n",

    "This is a well-known RL phenomena called **catastrophic forgetting**. It happens when the replay buffer mostly contains successful experiences, and the model forgets how to adapt or recover from bad states. One way to fix this is to change your buffer to keep 10 of experiences from previous epochs, and 90% of experiences from the current phase. Can you implement this?\n",

    "If things go well and your agent masters CartPole, the next harder challenges are [Acrobot-v1](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/v0.29.0/gymnasium/envs/classic_control/acrobot.py), and [MountainCar-v0](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/v0.29.0/gymnasium/envs/classic_control/mountain_car.py). These also have discrete action spaces, which are the only type we're dealing with today. Feel free to Google for appropriate hyperparameters for these other problems - in a real RL problem you would have to do hyperparameter search using the techniques we learned on a previous day because bad hyperparameters in RL often completely fail to learn, even if the algorithm is perfectly correct.\n",

    "- [microRTS](https://github.com/santiontanon/microrts) - a small real-time strategy game suitable for experimentation.\n",
    "- [Megastep](https://andyljones.com/megastep/) - RL environment that runs fully on the GPU (fast!)\n",
    "- [Procgen](https://github.com/openai/procgen) - A family of 16 procedurally generated gym environments to measure the ability for an agent to generalize. Optimized to run quickly on the CPU.\n",
