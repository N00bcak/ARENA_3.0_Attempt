    "This set of exercises lasts 2 days, and involves building and working with LLM agents. LLM agents consist of a scaffolding program interacting with an LLM API. We'll also build and analyse two tasks for LLM agents to complete, a simple and a complex one, in order to see how LLM agents act.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by building a simple Arithmetic Task and Arithmetic Agent. This should teach you the basics of function calling via the OpenAI API (Anthropic's API has minor differences, but operates in essentially the same way). Then, once we're comfortable with function calling and the general setup of LLM agents and tasks, we'll move on to building a more complex agent that plays the [Wikipedia Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll explore a variety of elicitation methods. These are methods for getting the best capabilities out of models, and are crucial for evaluating LLM agents. Looking at model performance with elicitation method help us to answer the question \"Can the model do this?\" Unfortunately, we'll almost never be able to *prove* that the model doesn't have a capability, and will only be able to say that *with some effort*, we couldn't get the model to demonstrate this capability. This means we'll have to put a lot of effort into trying to exhibit the behavior in models (to have the highest confidence when we make a claim that the model can't exhibit this behavior). This will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improving our prompting\n",
    "* Improving our tools\n",
    "* Improving the way the relevant information is stored\n",
    "* Ensuring the model can access good information\n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise will have a difficulty and importance rating out of 5, as well as an estimated maximum time you should spend on these exercises and sometimes a short annotation. You should interpret the ratings & time estimates relatively (e.g. if you find yourself spending about 50% longer on the exercises than the time estimates, adjust accordingly). Please do skip exercises / look at solutions if you don't feel like they're important enough to be worth doing, and you'd rather get to the good stuff!"

    "## What is an LLM agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM agent consists of a scaffolding program interacting with an LLM API to accomplish tasks in an external environment. This typically involves a loop of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The scaffolding program sends instructions to the LLM, typically containing information about the task goal, the possible actions available to the LLM, and any other relevant task information. (e.g. you are trying to calculate `3+3`)\n",
    "2. The LLM processes the input and outputs an action in text (e.g. \"calls\" the `calculate()` tool on the expression `3+3` in text).\n",
    "3. The scaffolding program executes the action and returns the outcome (e.g. it runs the `calculate()` function in the background and returns the output, `6`, to the agent).\n",
    "4. The LLM observes the results and decides the next action.\n",
    "5. Repeating the cycle until the task is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two basic components of scaffolding are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tool calling: This allows LLMs to use tools by providing a text description of the tool. The LLM can choose to use this tool by \"calling\" it in its text output. If it uses a tool, the scaffolding will execute this tool on the LLM's behalf (e.g. by running a python function, sending request to an external API etc.) and return the result of this tool call to the agent.\n",
    "* Prompting: This describes the task state to the LLM, describes the tools available to the LLM in the task, potentially instructs the LLM to use chain-of-thought to give the LLM more \"thinking time.\" This also covers how the LLM's `chat_history` is stored from the LLM's prior actions."

    "## Why evaluate LLM agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two reasons we want to evaluate LLM agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measuring the maximum capabilities of a model**\n",
    "\n",
    "For estimating safety risks, we want to measure the **ceiling** of dangerous capabilities. LLMs on their own often fail in easy-to-fix ways, as you will see. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They often claim to be incapable of tasks that they can actually perform.\n",
    "- They can *very* easily get stuck in loops.\n",
    "- They can give up and ask the user for help\n",
    "- They can hallucinate facts, or even misunderstand their own prior reasoning and hallucinate a faulty conclusion.\n",
    "- They can be limited by primitive tools.\n",
    "- They can be sensitive in strange ways to information in their prompts.\n",
    "- They can have bugs, typos, or other minor barriers that prevent them from operating to the fullest extent of their capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when a model fails to accomplish a task, it may still have the capability to succeed; requiring only simple fixes that will unlock this capability. We want to eliminate the possibility of large capability improvements from relatively little effort, because this means our evaluation would have underestimated the true capability and risks associated with a model (especially in e.g. a dangerous capabilities evaluation). Therefore, we to try hard to elicit their raw capabilities (e.g. using scaffolding), so that we can evaluate LLMs at their *best*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Measuring the alignment of LLMs in agentic scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not know if our current alignment techniques (e.g. supervised fine-tuning, RLHF) for aligning LLM chatbots will still work when LLMs are acting as agents in more complex scenarios. It is possible that these methods will not generalize well to agentic scenarios, and we may want to test this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know today that LLMs are being used as more than just chatbots. Since the release of ChatGPT, the use of LLMs as agentic systems has grown signifcantly. These agents started off rather disappointingly, when they were based on GPT-3.5. However as more powerful LLMs come out and AI companies ensure their LLMs are better at tool-use, these agents are improving rapidly.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `@property` decorator in python is used to define methods that behave like they were attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It allows you to access a method as though it were an attribute, without parentheses.\n",
    "2. It allows you to perform functions when calling attributes, e.g. adding validation or performing any necessary calculations (in our case incorporating class attributes which frequently change).\n",

    "- Provide extremely detailed descriptions. This is by far the most important factor in how effectively the model uses the tool. Your descriptions should explain every aspect of the tool, including:\n",
    "    - What the tool does\n",
    "    - When it should be used (and when it *shouldn’t*, if this confuses the model)\n",
    "    - What each parameter means and how it affects the tool’s behavior\n",
    "    - Any important caveats or limitations, such as what information the tool does not return if the tool name is unclear. \n",
    "- Prioritize descriptions over examples. While you can include examples of how to use a tool in its description or in the accompanying prompt, this is less important than having a clear and comprehensive explanation of the tool’s purpose and parameters. Only add examples after you’ve fully fleshed out the description.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more context you can give models about your tools, the better it will be at deciding when and how to use them. Aim for at least 3-4 sentences per tool description, more if the tool is complex.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `@staticmethod` decorator in Python defines a \"static method\" within a class, which has the following properties:\n",
    "1. They don't use instance- or class-specific data, thus does not require a first parameter `self` or `cls`.\n",
    "2. They're often used as utility functions related to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we defined a class of `MathOperations` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MathOperations:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def add(x : int | float, y : int | float) -> int | float:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Evaluates the string expression and returns the result as a string.\"\"\"\n",
    "        return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `add()` method could be called on the class itself without creating an instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = MathOperations.add(2, 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also call it on an instance of the class, but it doesn't utilize the instance in any way (it doesn't have access to `self`):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   operation = MathOperations()\n",
    "   result = operation.add(2, 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you would make \"stand-alone\" functions that do not depend on class methods or class/instance attributes a static method. Using `@staticmethod` in this case helps with the following:\n",
    "1. Makes the code's intent clearer (this method doesn't need class or instance data).\n",
    "2. Slightly improves performance (no `self` argument needs to be passed).\n",

Another issue that you might encounter is that the API formats mathematical expressions in $\\LaTeX$ quite poorly (for example, see the wikipedia API content for <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence\">Kullback-Leibler divergence</a>). This is why it's important to determine what content the wikipedia API produces when `.content` is called — and why you want to make sure you're testing a large diversity of wikipedia articles.\n",

For example, the page \"Python (programming language)\" is almost never referenced by its title, instead its almost always referenced as just \"Python\"; the same is true for cities and towns, which often have names such as e.g. \"Juneau, Alaska\", but these are almost always referred to as just \"Juneau\" in the articles where they appear. For this reason, you should avoid having goal pages which are likely to be referenced by a different string than their title.\n",

    "### Exercise - Build a WikiAgent\n",
    "> ```yaml\n",
    "> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪\n",
    "> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵\n",
    "> \n",
    "> You should spend up to 30-60 mins on this exercise.\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now build a `WikiAgent` that can use these tools to solve the `WikiGame`. We want to build the agent so that it can be called via an agent loop using the `run()` method, similar to the one we had for the arithmetic game. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few further considerations in this case that we didn't have for the arithmetic game. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context window constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Wikipedia articles could be very long, the length of the LLM's context window becomes a constraint. GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini both have context windows of 128k tokens (which corresponds to ~96k words). For reference, the wikipedia page for the United States has around 10k words alone and the agent will often need to visit more than 10 articles in one run of the game, not counting its own output, which can add up to be significant. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll solve this for now by simply resetting the messages of the agent every time it reaches a new wikipedia page, and providing an updated set of instructions, so the agent can locate itself in the game. We'll cover different methods for addressing this issue later, you can probably already think of some. So be careful to include the current page and goal page for the agent in the instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we'll reset the `chat_history` attribute of the agent class each time it reaches a new page, we'll also store a `full_chat_history` property that won't get reset, so we can access the entire run of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Printing output\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WikiGame` is a lot longer than the `ArithmeticTask`, with a much larger volume of agent, task and tool messages. If you don't want to see this output, you should use the `verbose` parameter to determine whether to print the output or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods of this class\n",
    "We've implemented two methods for this class which aren't very conceptually important, these are:\n",
    "- `handle_refusal()` - this only gets called if the ChatCompletionMessage has `response.refusal == True`, and adds the refusal to the chat history, and prints that the model has refused the request (in practice this virtually never happens).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reset_history()` - this is useful for dealing with context window constraints as mentioned above. This method should be called each time the model moves to a new page, to clear it's current chat history.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to implement the following methods:\n",
    "- `system_instruction` - this should return the system message we give to the model as it attempts the task. It should tell the model what the `WikiGame` is, and only the *basics* of how to play it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `on_page_instruction` - this should return a user message telling the model the specific page it is on, and the page it should try to reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `next_step_instruction` - this should return a user message that prompts the model to take its next action. This should be passed to the model after each time the model makes a tool call.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `update_history` - this should update the `WikiAgent.chat_history` with a message or list of messages (recall, a message can be a `dict` if it's generated by us, or a `ChatCompletionMessage` if its generated by the OpenAI API).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `start` - This should load the initial `system_instruction` and `on_page_instruction` into the `chat_history`, so that the model can start the `WikiGame` with the necessary instructions to know what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `handle_tool_calls` - This function should be used whenever the model makes a tool call. You should use the `execute_tool_calls` function that `WikiAgent` inherits from `SimpleAgent`.(use execute tool calls, add them to the chat history)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `run` - This function should run \"one loop\" of the Wikipedia game. This should be making a call to the LLM API, and using the methods in the rest of the class to handle the response, whether the response is a tool call, or purely a text response."

She was the last and longest reigning monarch of the <link>House of Tudor</link>. Her eventful reign, and its effect on history and culture, gave name to the <link>Elizabethan era</link>.\\nElizabeth was the only surviving child of <link>Henry VIII</link> and his second wife, <link>Anne Boleyn</link>. When Elizabeth was two years old, her parents\\' marriage was <link>annulled</link>, her mother was executed, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Henry restored her to the line of succession when she was 10. After Henry\\'s death in 1547, Elizabeth\\'s younger half-brother <link>Edward VI</link> ruled until his own death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to a <link>Protestant</link> cousin, <link>Lady Jane Grey</link>, and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, despite statutes to the contrary. Edward\\'s will was quickly set aside and the <link>Catholic</link> Mary became queen, deposing Jane. During Mary\\'s reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\\nUpon Mary\\'s 1558 death, Elizabeth succeeded to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel. She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers led by William Cecil, whom she created <link>Baron Burghley</link>. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the <link>supreme governor</link>. This arrangement, later named the <link>Elizabethan Religious Settlement</link>, would evolve into the <link>Church of England</link>. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did. Because of this she is sometimes referred to as the \"Virgin Queen\". She was succeeded by her cousin, <link>James VI of Scotland</link>.\\nIn government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and siblings had been. One of her <link>mottoes</link> was video et taceo (\"I see and keep silent\"). In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570, which in theory released English Catholics from allegiance to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers\\' secret service, run by <link>Francis Walsingham</link>. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain. She half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. By the mid-1580s, England could no longer avoid war with Spain.\\nAs she grew older, Elizabeth became celebrated for her <link>virginity</link>. A <link>cult of personality</link> grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. The Elizabethan era is famous for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as <link>William Shakespeare</link> and <link>Christopher Marlowe</link>, the prowess of English maritime adventurers, such as <link>Francis Drake</link> and <link>Walter Raleigh</link>, and for the defeat of the <link>Spanish Armada</link>. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her fair share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer (\"<link>Gloriana</link>\") and a dogged survivor (\"Good Queen Bess\") in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. After the short, disastrous reigns of her half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped to forge a sense of national identity.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nElizabeth was born at <link>Greenwich Palace</link> on 7 September 1533 and was named after her grandmothers, <link>Elizabeth of York</link> and <link>Lady Elizabeth Howard</link>. She was the second child of <link>Henry VIII of England</link> born in wedlock to survive infancy. Her mother was Henry VIII\\'s second wife, Anne Boleyn. At birth, Elizabeth was the <link>heir presumptive</link> to the English throne. Her elder half-sister Mary had lost her position as a legitimate heir when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary\\'s mother, <link>Catherine of Aragon</link>, to marry Anne, with the intent to sire a male heir and ensure the Tudor succession. She was baptised on 10 September 1533, and her godparents were <link>Thomas Cranmer</link>, <link>Archbishop of Canterbury</link>; <link>Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter</link>; <link>Elizabeth Stafford, Duchess of Norfolk</link>; and <link>Margaret Wotton, Dowager Marchioness of Dorset</link>. A canopy was carried at the ceremony over the infant by her uncle <link>George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford</link>; <link>John Hussey, Baron Hussey of Sleaford</link>; <link>Lord Thomas Howard</link>; and <link>William Howard, Baron Howard of Effingham</link>.\\nElizabeth was two years and eight months old when her mother was beheaded on 19 May 1536, four months after Catherine of Aragon\\'s death from natural causes. Elizabeth was declared illegitimate and deprived of her place in the royal succession. Eleven days after Anne Boleyn\\'s execution, Henry married <link>Jane Seymour</link>. Queen Jane died the next year shortly after the birth of their son, Edward, who was the undisputed <link>heir apparent</link> to the throne. Elizabeth was placed in her half-brother\\'s household and carried the <link>chrisom</link>, or baptismal cloth, at his christening.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s first <link>governess</link>, <link>Margaret Bryan</link>, wrote that she was \"as toward a child and as gentle of conditions as ever I knew any in my life\". <link>Catherine Champernowne</link>, better known by her later, married name of Catherine \"Kat\" Ashley, was appointed as Elizabeth\\'s governess in 1537, and she remained Elizabeth\\'s friend until her death in 1565. Champernowne taught Elizabeth four languages: French, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish. By the time <link>William Grindal</link> became her tutor in 1544, Elizabeth could write English, <link>Latin</link>, and Italian. Under Grindal, a talented and skilful tutor, she also progressed in French and Greek. By the age of 12, she was able to translate her stepmother <link>Catherine Parr</link>\\'s religious work <link>Prayers or Meditations</link> from English into Italian, Latin, and French, which she presented to her father as a New Year\\'s gift. From her teenage years and throughout her life, she translated works in Latin and Greek by numerous classical authors, including the <link>Pro Marcello</link> of <link>Cicero</link>, the <link>De consolatione philosophiae</link> of <link>Boethius</link>, a treatise by <link>Plutarch</link>, and the Annals of <link>Tacitus</link>. A translation of Tacitus from <link>Lambeth Palace</link> Library, one of only four surviving English translations from the early modern era, was confirmed as Elizabeth\\'s own in 2019, after a detailed analysis of the handwriting and paper was undertaken.\\nAfter Grindal died in 1548, Elizabeth received her education under her brother Edward\\'s tutor, <link>Roger Ascham</link>, a sympathetic teacher who believed that learning should be engaging. Current knowledge of Elizabeth\\'s schooling and precocity comes largely from Ascham\\'s memoirs. By the time her formal education ended in 1550, Elizabeth was one of the best educated women of her generation. At the end of her life, she was believed to speak the Welsh, Cornish, Scottish, and <link>Irish language</link>s in addition to those mentioned above. The Venetian ambassador stated in 1603 that she \"possessed [these] languages so thoroughly that each appeared to be her native tongue\". Historian <link>Mark Stoyle</link> suggests that she was probably taught Cornish by William Killigrew, Groom of the Privy Chamber and later <link>Chamberlain of the Exchequer</link>.\\n\\n\\n== Thomas Seymour ==\\n\\nHenry VIII died in 1547 and Elizabeth\\'s half-brother, Edward VI, became king at the age of nine. Catherine Parr, Henry\\'s widow, soon married <link>Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley</link>, Edward VI\\'s uncle and the brother of Lord Protector <link>Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset</link>. The couple took Elizabeth into their household at Chelsea. There Elizabeth experienced an emotional crisis that some historians believe affected her for the rest of her life. Thomas Seymour engaged in romps and horseplay with the 14-year-old Elizabeth, including entering her bedroom in his nightgown, tickling her, and slapping her on the buttocks. Elizabeth rose early and surrounded herself with maids to avoid his unwelcome morning visits. Parr, rather than confront her husband over his inappropriate activities, joined in. Twice she accompanied him in tickling Elizabeth, and once held her while he cut her black gown \"into a thousand pieces\". However, after Parr discovered the pair in an embrace, she ended this state of affairs. In May 1548, Elizabeth was sent away.\\nThomas Seymour nevertheless continued scheming to control the royal family and tried to have himself appointed the governor of the King\\'s person. When Parr died after childbirth on 5 September 1548, he renewed his attentions towards Elizabeth, intent on marrying her. Her governess <link>Kat Ashley</link>, who was fond of Seymour, sought to convince Elizabeth to take him as her husband. She tried to convince Elizabeth to write to Seymour and \"comfort him in his sorrow\", but Elizabeth claimed that Thomas was not so saddened by her stepmother\\'s death as to need comfort.\\nIn January 1549, Seymour was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower on suspicion of conspiring to depose his brother Somerset as Protector, marry Lady <link>Jane Grey</link> to King Edward VI, and take Elizabeth as his own wife. Elizabeth, living at <link>Hatfield House</link>, would admit nothing. Her stubbornness exasperated her interrogator, Robert Tyrwhitt, who reported, \"I do see it in her face that she is guilty\". Seymour was beheaded on 20 March 1549.\\n\\n\\n== Reign of Mary ==\\n\\nEdward VI died on 6 July 1553, aged 15. His will ignored the <link>Succession to the Crown Act 1543</link>, excluded both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir Lady Jane Grey, granddaughter of Henry VIII\\'s younger sister <link>Mary Tudor, Queen of France</link>. Jane was proclaimed queen by the privy council, but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days. On 3 August 1553, Mary rode triumphantly into London, with Elizabeth at her side. The show of solidarity between the sisters did not last long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth outwardly conformed. Mary\\'s initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Philip of Spain, the son of <link>Holy Roman Emperor Charles V</link> and a Catholic. Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary\\'s religious policies.\\nIn January and February 1554, <link>Wyatt\\'s rebellion</link> broke out; it was soon suppressed. Elizabeth was brought to court and interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the <link>Tower of London</link>. Elizabeth fervently protested her innocence. Though it is unlikely that she had plotted with the rebels, some of them were known to have approached her. Mary\\'s closest confidant, Emperor Charles\\'s ambassador <link>Simon Renard</link>, argued that her throne would never be safe while Elizabeth lived; and Lord Chancellor <link>Stephen Gardiner</link>, worked to have Elizabeth put on trial. Elizabeth\\'s supporters in the government, including <link>William Paget, 1st Baron Paget</link>, convinced Mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. Instead, on 22 May, Elizabeth was moved from the Tower to <link>Woodstock Palace</link>, where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of <link>Henry Bedingfeld</link>. Crowds cheered her all along the way.\\nOn 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was recalled to court to attend the final stages of Mary\\'s apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen, but if Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth\\'s chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. When it became clear that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child. Elizabeth\\'s succession seemed assured.\\nKing Philip, who ascended the Spanish throne in 1556, acknowledged the new political reality and cultivated his sister-in-law. She was a better ally than the chief alternative, <link>Mary, Queen of Scots</link>, who had grown up in France and was betrothed to Francis, Dauphin of France. When his wife fell ill in 1558, Philip sent the Count of Feria to consult with Elizabeth. This interview was conducted at Hatfield House, where she had returned to live in October 1555. By October 1558, Elizabeth was already making plans for her government. Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir on 6 November 1558 and Elizabeth became queen when Mary died on 17 November.\\n\\n\\n== Accession ==\\n\\nElizabeth became queen at the age of 25, and declared her intentions to her council and other peers who had come to Hatfield to swear allegiance. The speech contains the first record of her adoption of the medieval <link>political theology</link> of the sovereign\\'s \"two bodies\": the body natural and the <link>body politic</link>:\\n\\nMy lords, the law of nature moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, considering I am God\\'s creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring from the bottom of my heart that I may have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me. And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all ... to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.\\nAs her <link>triumphal progress</link> wound through the city on the eve of the coronation ceremony, she was welcomed wholeheartedly by the citizens and greeted by orations and pageants, most with a strong Protestant flavour. Elizabeth\\'s open and gracious responses endeared her to the spectators, who were \"wonderfully ravished\". The following day, 15 January 1559, a date chosen by her astrologer <link>John Dee</link>, Elizabeth was crowned and anointed by <link>Owen Oglethorpe</link>, the Catholic <link>bishop of Carlisle</link>, in <link>Westminster Abbey</link>. She was then presented for the people\\'s acceptance, amidst a deafening noise of organs, fifes, trumpets, drums, and bells. Although Elizabeth was welcomed as queen in England, the country was still in a state of anxiety over the perceived Catholic threat at home and overseas, as well as the choice of whom she would marry.\\n\\n\\n== Church settlement ==\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s personal religious convictions have been much debated by scholars. She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the <link>crucifix</link>), and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief.\\nElizabeth and her advisers perceived the threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. The Queen therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants, but she would not tolerate the <link>Puritan</link>s, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the Parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as <link>vestments</link>.\\nThe House of Commons backed the proposals strongly, but the bill of supremacy met opposition in the <link>House of Lords</link>, particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the <link>Archbishopric of Canterbury</link>. This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of <link>Supreme Governor of the Church of England</link> rather than the more contentious title of <link>Supreme Head</link>, which many thought unacceptable for a woman to bear. The new Act of Supremacy became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were forced to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the <link>heresy</link> laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters by Mary. At the same time, a new Act of Uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of the 1559 <link>Book of Common Prayer</link> (an adapted version of the <link>1552 prayer book</link>) compulsory, though the penalties for <link>recusancy</link>, or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.\\n\\n\\n== Marriage question ==\\nFrom the start of Elizabeth\\'s reign it was expected that she would marry, and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers, she never married and remained childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships. She considered several suitors until she was about 50 years old. Her last courtship was with <link>Francis, Duke of Anjou</link>, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King <link>Philip II of Spain</link>, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.\\n\\n\\n=== Robert Dudley ===\\n\\nIn the spring of 1559, it became evident that Elizabeth was in love with her childhood friend Robert Dudley. It was said that his wife Amy was suffering from a \"malady in one of her breasts\" and that the Queen would like to marry Robert if his wife should die. By the autumn of 1559, several foreign suitors were vying for Elizabeth\\'s hand; their impatient envoys engaged in ever more scandalous talk and reported that a marriage with her <link>favourite</link> was not welcome in England: \"There is not a man who does not cry out on him and her with indignation ... she will marry none but the favoured Robert.\" Amy Dudley died in September 1560, from a fall from a flight of stairs and, despite the <link>coroner</link>\\'s <link>inquest</link> finding of accident, many people suspected her husband of having arranged her death so that he could marry the Queen. Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley for some time. However, William Cecil, <link>Nicholas Throckmorton</link>, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear. There were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place.\\nAmong other marriage candidates being considered for the queen, Robert Dudley continued to be regarded as a possible candidate for nearly another decade. Elizabeth was extremely jealous of his affections, even when she no longer meant to marry him herself. She raised Dudley to the peerage as <link>Earl of Leicester</link> in 1564. In 1578, he finally married <link>Lettice Knollys</link>, to whom the queen reacted with repeated scenes of displeasure and lifelong hatred. Still, Dudley always \"remained at the centre of [Elizabeth\\'s] emotional life\", as historian <link>Susan Doran</link> has described the situation. He died shortly after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. After Elizabeth\\'s own death, a note from him was found among her most personal belongings, marked \"his last letter\" in her handwriting.\\n\\n\\n=== Foreign candidates ===\\nMarriage negotiations constituted a key element in Elizabeth\\'s foreign policy. She turned down the hand of Philip, her half-sister\\'s widower, early in 1559 but for several years entertained the proposal of King <link>Eric XIV of Sweden</link>. Earlier in Elizabeth\\'s life, a Danish match for her had been discussed; Henry VIII had proposed one with the Danish prince <link>Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp</link>, in 1545, and Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, suggested a marriage with Prince Frederick (later Frederick II) several years later, but the negotiations had abated in 1551. In the years around 1559, a Dano-English Protestant alliance was considered, and to counter Sweden\\'s proposal, King Frederick II proposed to Elizabeth in late 1559.\\n\\nFor several years, she seriously negotiated to marry Philip\\'s cousin <link>Charles II, Archduke of Austria</link>. By 1569, relations with the <link>Habsburgs</link> had deteriorated. Elizabeth considered marriage to two French Valois princes in turn, first <link>Henry, Duke of Anjou</link>, and then from 1572 to 1581 his brother Francis, Duke of Anjou, formerly Duke of Alençon. This last proposal was tied to a planned alliance against Spanish control of the <link>Southern Netherlands</link>. Elizabeth seems to have taken the courtship seriously for a time, wearing a frog-shaped earring that Francis had sent her.\\nIn 1563, Elizabeth told an imperial envoy: \"If I follow the inclination of my nature, it is this: beggar-woman and single, far rather than queen and married\". Later in the year, following Elizabeth\\'s illness with <link>smallpox</link>, the succession question became a heated issue in Parliament. Members urged the Queen to marry or nominate an heir, to prevent a civil war upon her death. She refused to do either. In April she prorogued the Parliament, which did not reconvene until she needed its support to raise taxes in 1566.\\nHaving previously promised to marry, she told an unruly House:\\n\\nI will never break the word of a prince spoken in public place, for my honour\\'s sake. And therefore I say again, I will marry as soon as I can conveniently, if God take not him away with whom I mind to marry, or myself, or else some other great let [obstruction] happen.\\nBy 1570, senior figures in the government privately accepted that Elizabeth would never marry or name a successor. William Cecil was already seeking solutions to the succession problem. For her failure to marry, Elizabeth was often accused of irresponsibility. Her silence, however, strengthened her own political security: she knew that if she named an heir, her throne would be vulnerable to a coup; she remembered the way that \"a second person, as I have been\" had been used as the focus of plots against her predecessor.\\n\\n\\n=== Virginity ===\\nElizabeth\\'s unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity related to that of the Virgin Mary. In poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin, a goddess, or both, not as a normal woman. At first, only Elizabeth made a virtue of her ostensible virginity: in 1559, she told the Commons, \"And, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin\". Later on, poets and writers took up the theme and developed an <link>iconography</link> that exalted Elizabeth. Public tributes to the Virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queen\\'s marriage negotiations with the Duke of Alençon. Ultimately, Elizabeth would insist she was married to her kingdom and subjects, under divine protection. In 1599, she spoke of \"all my husbands, my good people\".\\n\\nThis claim of virginity was not universally accepted. Catholics accused Elizabeth of engaging in \"filthy lust\" that symbolically defiled the nation along with her body. <link>Henry IV of France</link> said that one of the great questions of Europe was \"whether Queen Elizabeth was a maid or no\".\\nA central issue, when it comes to the question of Elizabeth\\'s virginity, was whether the Queen ever consummated her love affair with Robert Dudley. In 1559, she had Dudley\\'s bedchambers moved next to her own apartments. In 1561, she was mysteriously bedridden with an illness that caused her body to swell.\\nIn 1587, a young man calling himself <link>Arthur Dudley</link> was arrested on the coast of Spain under suspicion of being a spy. The man claimed to be the illegitimate son of Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, with his age being consistent with birth during the 1561 illness. He was taken to <link>Madrid</link> for investigation, where he was examined by <link>Francis Englefield</link>, a Catholic aristocrat exiled to Spain and secretary to King Philip II. Three letters exist today describing the interview, detailing what Arthur proclaimed to be the story of his life, from birth in the royal palace to the time of his arrival in Spain. However, this failed to convince the Spaniards: Englefield admitted to King Philip that Arthur\\'s \"claim at present amounts to nothing\", but suggested that \"he should not be allowed to get away, but [...] kept very secure.\" The King agreed, and Arthur was never heard from again. Modern scholarship dismisses the story\\'s basic premise as \"impossible\", and asserts that Elizabeth\\'s life was so closely observed by contemporaries that she could not have hidden a pregnancy.\\n\\n\\n== Mary, Queen of Scots ==\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s first policy toward Scotland was to oppose the French presence there. She feared that the French planned to invade England and put her Catholic cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. Mary was considered by many to be the heir to the English crown, being the granddaughter of Henry VIII\\'s elder sister, Margaret. Mary boasted being \"the nearest kinswoman she hath\". Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting <link>Treaty of Edinburgh</link> of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north. When Mary returned from France to Scotland in 1561 to take up the reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was run by a council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth. Mary refused to ratify the treaty.\\nIn 1563, Elizabeth proposed her own suitor, Robert Dudley, as a husband for Mary, without asking either of the two people concerned. Both proved unenthusiastic, and in 1565, Mary married <link>Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley</link>, who carried his own claim to the English throne. The marriage was the first of a series of errors of judgement by Mary that handed the victory to the Scottish Protestants and to Elizabeth. Darnley quickly became unpopular and was murdered in February 1567 by conspirators almost certainly led by <link>James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell</link>. Shortly afterwards, on 15 May 1567, Mary married Bothwell, arousing suspicions that she had been party to the murder of her husband. Elizabeth confronted Mary about the marriage, writing to her:\\n\\nHow could a worse choice be made for your honour than in such haste to marry such a subject, who besides other and notorious lacks, public fame has charged with the murder of your late husband, besides the touching of yourself also in some part, though we trust in that behalf falsely.\\nThese events led rapidly to Mary\\'s defeat and imprisonment in <link>Lochleven Castle</link>. The Scottish lords forced her to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son, <link>James VI</link>. James was taken to <link>Stirling Castle</link> to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped in 1568 but after a defeat at Langside sailed to England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth\\'s first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch, but she and her council instead chose to play safe. Rather than risk returning Mary to Scotland with an English army or sending her to France and the Catholic enemies of England, they detained her in England, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.\\n\\n\\n=== Catholic cause ===\\n\\nMary was soon the focus for rebellion. In 1569 there was a major Catholic rising in the North; the goal was to free Mary, marry her to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and put her on the English throne. After the rebels\\' defeat, over 750 of them were executed on Elizabeth\\'s orders. In the belief that the revolt had been successful, <link>Pope Pius V</link> issued a bull in 1570, titled <link>Regnans in Excelsis</link>, which declared \"Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime\" to be excommunicated and a <link>heretic</link>, releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her. Catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with <link>excommunication</link>. The <link>papal bull</link> provoked legislative initiatives against Catholics by Parliament, which were, however, mitigated by Elizabeth\\'s intervention. In 1581, to convert English subjects to Catholicism with \"the intent\" to withdraw them from their allegiance to Elizabeth was made a treasonable offence, carrying the death penalty. From the 1570s <link>missionary</link> priests from continental <link>seminaries</link> went to England secretly in the cause of the \"reconversion of England\". Some were executed for treasonable conduct, engendering a cult of <link>martyrdom</link>.\\nRegnans in Excelsis gave English Catholics a strong incentive to look to Mary as the legitimate sovereign of England. Mary may not have been told of every Catholic plot to put her on the English throne, but from the <link>Ridolfi Plot</link> of 1571 (which caused Mary\\'s suitor, the Duke of Norfolk, to lose his head) to the <link>Babington Plot</link> of 1586, Elizabeth\\'s <link>spymaster</link> Francis Walsingham and the royal council keenly assembled a case against her. At first, Elizabeth resisted calls for Mary\\'s death. By late 1586, she had been persuaded to sanction Mary\\'s trial and execution on the evidence of letters written during the Babington Plot. Elizabeth\\'s proclamation of the sentence announced that \"the said Mary, pretending title to the same Crown, had compassed and imagined within the same realm diverse things tending to the hurt, death and destruction of our royal person.\" On 8 February 1587, Mary was beheaded at <link>Fotheringhay Castle</link>, Northamptonshire. After the execution, Elizabeth claimed that she had not intended for the signed execution warrant to be dispatched, and blamed her secretary, William Davison, for implementing it without her knowledge. The sincerity of Elizabeth\\'s remorse and whether or not she wanted to delay the warrant have been called into question both by her contemporaries and later historians.\\n\\n\\n== Wars ==\\nElizabeth\\'s foreign policy was largely defensive. The exception was the English occupation of <link>Le Havre</link> from October 1562 to June 1563, which ended in failure when Elizabeth\\'s <link>Huguenot</link> allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port. Elizabeth\\'s intention had been to exchange Le Havre for Calais, lost to France in January 1558. Only through the activities of her fleets did Elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy. This paid off in the war against Spain, 80% of which was fought at sea. She knighted Francis Drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from 1577 to 1580, and he won fame for his raids on Spanish ports and fleets. An element of <link>piracy</link> and self-enrichment drove Elizabethan seafarers, over whom the Queen had little control.\\n\\n\\n=== Netherlands ===\\n\\nAfter the occupation and loss of Le Havre in 1562–1563, Elizabeth avoided military expeditions on the continent until 1585, when she sent an English army to aid the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip II. This followed the deaths in 1584 of the Queen\\'s allies <link>William the Silent</link>, Prince of Orange, and the Duke of Anjou, and the surrender of a series of Dutch towns to <link>Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma</link>, Philip\\'s governor of the <link>Spanish Netherlands</link>. In December 1584, an alliance between Philip II and the French Catholic League at Joinville undermined the ability of Anjou\\'s brother, <link>Henry III of France</link>, to counter Spanish domination of the Netherlands. It also extended Spanish influence along the channel coast of France, where the Catholic League was strong, and exposed England to invasion. The siege of Antwerp in the summer of 1585 by the Duke of Parma necessitated some reaction on the part of the English and the Dutch. The outcome was the <link>Treaty of Nonsuch</link> of August 1585, in which Elizabeth promised military support to the Dutch. The treaty marked the beginning of the Anglo-Spanish War.\\nThe expedition was led by Elizabeth\\'s former suitor, the Earl of Leicester. Elizabeth from the start did not really back this course of action. Her strategy, to support the Dutch on the surface with an English army, while beginning secret peace talks with Spain within days of Leicester\\'s arrival in Holland, had necessarily to be at odds with Leicester\\'s, who had set up a protectorate and was expected by the Dutch to fight an active campaign. Elizabeth, on the other hand, wanted him \"to avoid at all costs any decisive action with the enemy\". He enraged Elizabeth by accepting the post of Governor-General from the <link>Dutch States General</link>. Elizabeth saw this as a Dutch ploy to force her to accept sovereignty over the Netherlands, which so far she had always declined. She wrote to Leicester:\\n\\nWe could never have imagined (had we not seen it fall out in experience) that a man raised up by ourself and extraordinarily favoured by us, above any other subject of this land, would have in so contemptible a sort broken our commandment in a cause that so greatly touches us in honour ... And therefore our express pleasure and commandment is that, all delays and excuses laid apart, you do presently upon the duty of your allegiance obey and fulfill whatsoever the bearer hereof shall direct you to do in our name. Whereof fail you not, as you will answer the contrary at your utmost peril.\\nElizabeth\\'s \"commandment\" was that her emissary read out her letters of disapproval publicly before the Dutch Council of State, Leicester having to stand nearby. This public humiliation of her \"Lieutenant-General\" combined with her continued talks for a separate peace with Spain irreversibly undermined Leicester\\'s standing among the Dutch. The military campaign was severely hampered by Elizabeth\\'s repeated refusals to send promised funds for her starving soldiers. Her unwillingness to commit herself to the cause, Leicester\\'s own shortcomings as a political and military leader, and the faction-ridden and chaotic situation of Dutch politics led to the failure of the campaign. Leicester finally resigned his command in December 1587. The Spanish still controlled the southern provinces of the Netherlands, and the threat of the invasion of England remained.\\nSupport for the Dutch nevertheless continued. Leicester\\'s replacement was <link>Francis Vere</link> who became sergeant major-general of all Elizabeth\\'s troops in the Low Countries by 1589. This was a position he retained during fifteen campaigns with almost unbroken success. Vere enjoyed excellent relations with the Dutch under <link>Maurice of Nassau</link>, and worked in close co-operation with them to help secure the country for the cause of independence. Vere\\'s troops shattered the myth of Spanish invincibility, and he thus secured Elizabeth\\'s respect and admiration. English support for the Dutch finished after Elizabeth\\'s death, but by that time the Dutch were strong enough to hold their own.\\n\\n\\n=== Spain ===\\n\\nWith England at war with Spain in 1585, Francis Drake undertook a year long voyage raiding Spanish ports and ships in the <link>Caribbean</link>. In 1587 he made a successful raid on <link>Cádiz</link>, destroying the Spanish fleet of war ships intended for the Enterprise of England, as Philip II had decided to take the war to England.\\nOn 12 July 1588, the Spanish Armada, a great fleet of ships, set sail for the channel, planning to ferry a Spanish invasion force under the Duke of Parma to the coast of southeast England from the Netherlands. To intercept the Armada, Elizabeth sent her navy led by Francis Drake and Charles Howard. The armada was defeated by a combination of miscalculation, misfortune, and an attack of English <link>fire ships</link> off <link>Gravelines</link> at midnight on 28–29 July (7–8 August New Style), which dispersed the Spanish ships to the northeast. The Armada straggled home to Spain in shattered remnants, after disastrous losses on the coast of Ireland (after some ships had tried to struggle back to Spain via the <link>North Sea</link>, and then back south past the west coast of Ireland). Unaware of the Armada\\'s fate, English militias mustered to defend the country under the Earl of Leicester\\'s command. Leicester invited Elizabeth to inspect her troops at <link>Tilbury</link> in Essex on 8 August. Wearing a silver breastplate over a white velvet dress, she addressed them in her <link>Speech to the Troops at Tilbury</link>:\\n\\nMy loving people, we have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you, I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people ... I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.\\n\\nWhen no invasion came, the nation rejoiced. Elizabeth\\'s procession to a thanksgiving service at St Paul\\'s Cathedral rivalled that of her coronation as a spectacle. The defeat of the armada was a potent propaganda victory, both for Elizabeth and for Protestant England. The English took their delivery as a symbol of God\\'s favour and of the nation\\'s inviolability under a virgin queen. However, the victory was not a turning point in the war, which continued for another sixteen years.\\nIn 1589, the year after the Spanish Armada, Elizabeth sent to Spain the <link>English Armada</link> or Counter Armada with 23,375 men and 150 ships, led by Francis Drake as admiral and John Norreys as general. The English fleet suffered a catastrophic defeat with 11,000–15,000 killed, wounded or died of disease and 40 ships sunk or captured. The advantage England had won upon the destruction of the Spanish Armada was lost, and the Spanish victory marked a revival of Philip II\\'s naval power through the next decade.\\nWhile the English navy kept an eye on the next invasion, it was left for English privateers to see to the hunt for Spanish and Portuguese treasure ships. They would take part in highly lucrative joint stock expeditions to raid and plunder settlements and shipping in the Atlantic and on the Spanish Main. Known as <link>Elizabethan Sea Dogs</link>; they included the likes of Drake, Hawkins and Raleigh. Elizabeth\\'s court and powerful London merchants were at the forefront of promoting, equipping and financing these expeditions, which were authorized by Elizabeth. She alone would receive nearly a third of the profits, which in addition filled her realm\\'s coffers. One of the most notable prizes was a large and highly valuable Portuguese <link>Carrack</link>, the <link>Madre de Deus</link> which was taken in battle off the Azores in 1592. It was subject to mass theft after arrival in Dartmouth, which angered Elizabeth, but even so the rest of the cargo was still half the wealth of the English treasury at the time.\\nThere were a number of failures; the most notable being Drake and Hawkins on a disastrous expedition to the Caribbean in 1595 during which both died, the news of which shocked Elizabeth. Despite this, a new breed of Sea Dogs came to fruition, the likes of <link>James Lancaster</link>, William Parker and the most successful of all <link>Christopher Newport</link>. Although they failed to capture any of the major treasure ships, Elizabeth\\'s \\'Sea Dogs\\' were highly successful; a strategy of harassment brought in an average of 15% of nation\\'s imports every year throughout the war.\\nIn 1596 Elizabeth sent the second English armada to Cádiz, in the hope of seizing the treasure fleet. Led by her favorite the Earl of Essex, Elizabeth\\'s fleet with Dutch support, succeeded in capturing Cádiz costing the Spanish some 32 ships sunk along with the treasure in them. The victory was hailed as a triumph, and Essex became a hero - his prestige rivalling Elizabeth\\'s. The Queen accused Essex of pilfering Spanish treasure, and questioned why he had dished out knighthoods whilst in Cádiz, reminding him he had no authority to do so.\\nMeanwhile, in revenge for Cádiz, Philip II sent his <link>second Spanish Armada</link> to England a few months later, but this met with disaster - storms swept away the fleet before it saw sight of England, costing nearly 5,000 men and 40 ships sunk. This, along with the Cádiz raid forced Spain to declare bankruptcy that year. Undeterred, Philip sent the <link>third Armada</link> in 1597, but near the English coast another storm dispersed the fleet, losing another 28 ships sunk or captured and 2,000 men. Elizabeth awarded Charles Howard the title of the <link>Earl of Nottingham</link> for his performance during the campaign. The Queen nevertheless was furious with the Earl of Essex who had been away on a failed expedition to the Azores, accusing him of making England defenseless – their relationship became ever more strained.\\nAfter the death of Philip II in 1598, his successor Philip III built up his fleet once more and sent the <link>fourth Spanish Armada</link> to Ireland in 1601 to assist the rebels there. The Spanish this time made landfall and held the town of <link>Kinsale</link> for three months but following the defeat of the rebels outside the town the Spanish were forced to surrender their entire force along the Southwest Irish coast. This defeat weakened Spanish resolve in the war against England; both sides were nevertheless exhausted and peace was signed between England and Spain with the Treaty of London in 1604, a year after Elizabeth\\'s death.\\nWalter Raleigh claimed after her death that Elizabeth\\'s caution had impeded the war against Spain:\\n\\nIf the late queen would have believed her men of war as she did her scribes, we had in her time beaten that great empire in pieces and made their kings of figs and oranges as in old times. But her Majesty did all by halves, and by petty invasions taught the Spaniard how to defend himself, and to see his own weakness.\\nThough some historians have criticised Elizabeth on similar grounds, Elizabeth had good reason not to place too much trust in her commanders, who once in action tended, as she put it herself, \"to be transported with an haviour of vainglory\".\\n\\n\\n=== France ===\\n\\nWhen the Protestant Henry IV inherited the French throne in 1589, Elizabeth sent him military support. It was her first venture into France since the retreat from Le Havre in 1563. Henry\\'s succession was strongly contested by the Catholic League and by Philip II, and Elizabeth feared a Spanish takeover of the channel ports.\\nThe subsequent early English campaigns in France, however, were disorganised and ineffective. Peregrine Bertie, largely ignoring Elizabeth\\'s orders, roamed northern France to little effect, with an army of 4,000 men. He withdrew in disarray in December 1590 following the failure of the Siege of Paris. The following year, John Norreys, led 3,000 men to campaign in Brittany, which despite victory at Quenelec in June ended inconclusively.\\nIn July, Elizabeth sent out another force under <link>Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex</link>, to help Henry IV in besieging Rouen which Norreys joined. Essex however accomplished nothing and returned home in January 1592, and Henry abandoned the siege in April. As usual, Elizabeth lacked control over her commanders once they were abroad. \"Where he is, or what he doth, or what he is to do,\" she wrote of Essex, \"we are ignorant\". Norreys left for London to plead in person for more support. Elizabeth dithered, and in Norreys\\' absence in May 1592, a Catholic League and Spanish army almost destroyed the remains of his army at Craon, north-west France. As for all such expeditions, Elizabeth was unwilling to invest in the supplies and reinforcements requested by the commanders.\\nIn March 1593, Henry converted to Catholicism in Paris to secure his hold on the French crown. Elizabeth was distraught and shocked at this move, and she resented any further attempts by Henry to win her over and ordered all of her forces home. Despite this, the Catholic leaguers did not trust Henry and still opposed him - their Spanish allies meanwhile continued to campaign in Brittany and advanced on the major port of Brest. King Philip of Spain was intent on establishing advanced bases in western France from which his rebuilt navy could constantly threaten England. Norreys wrote to Elizabeth warning her about this threat - and after some hesitation saw the danger and so sent another force in 1594. Norreys with 4,000 men worked with his French counterpart <link>Jean VI d\\'Aumont</link>. This time success was achieved; after taking a number of towns, they laid siege to an encroaching Spanish fort near Brest which was overrun and destroyed. This was a decisive victory ending the threat, and not long after the Catholic league collapsed. Elizabeth hailed Norreys a hero, but then ordered him back to England along with his troops.\\nIn 1595 Henry declared war on Spain and wanted England to form an alliance with France. Elizabeth however was not interested, owing to her mistrust of Henry and the fear that France was becoming more dominant. The Spanish however captured Calais in 1596, and with Spain now in sight of England once more, Elizabeth relented – the triple alliance was formed along with the <link>Dutch Republic</link>. Elizabeth however still hesitated, attempting to barter for either Boulogne or an indemnity in money, the latter of which was agreed. When Spanish forces seized <link>Amiens</link> in March 1597, Elizabeth sent a force of some 4,200 men under Thomas Baskerville to Picardy, joining Henry\\'s forces. The Anglo-French force arrived, then besieged Amiens and drove off a relief army. The town then surrendered, following which French overtures for peace with Spain began. Henry wanted Elizabeth to be part of this peace but she refused, reminding him of the alliance with the Dutch. Henry ultimately went behind Elizabeth\\'s back to sign the peace with Spain at Vervins. She thus accused the French king of \\'perfidy and double-dealing\\'.\\n\\n\\n=== Ireland ===\\n\\nAlthough Ireland was one of her two kingdoms, Elizabeth faced a hostile, and in places virtually autonomous, Irish population that adhered to Catholicism and was willing to defy her authority and plot with her enemies. Her policy there was to grant land to her <link>courtiers</link> and prevent the rebels from giving Spain a base from which to attack England. In the course of a series of uprisings, Crown forces pursued <link>scorched-earth</link> tactics, burning the land and slaughtering man, woman and child. During a revolt in <link>Munster</link> led by Gerald FitzGerald, Earl of Desmond, in 1582, an estimated 30,000 Irish people starved to death. The poet and colonist <link>Edmund Spenser</link> wrote that the victims \"were brought to such wretchedness as that any stony heart would have rued the same\". Elizabeth advised her commanders that the Irish, \"that rude and barbarous nation\", be well treated, but she or her commanders showed no remorse when force and bloodshed served their authoritarian purpose.\\nBetween 1593 and 1603, Elizabeth faced her most severe test in Ireland during the Nine Years\\' War, a revolt that took place at the height of hostilities with Spain, who backed the rebel leader, <link>Hugh O\\'Neill, Earl of Tyrone</link>. In spring 1599, Elizabeth sent Robert Devereux to put the revolt down. To her frustration, he made little progress and returned to England in defiance of her orders. He was replaced by Charles Blount, who within three years defeated the rebels who were supported by the Spanish. The decisive battle took place at Kinsale in 1602; Elizabeth lauded the victory, hailing Mountjoy a hero. The financial cost of the Irish war however was considerable and Elizabeth\\'s realm only just avoided bankruptcy. O\\'Neill finally surrendered in 1603 at the <link>Treaty of Mellifont</link>, a few days after Elizabeth\\'s death.\\n\\n\\n== Overseas trade ==\\n\\n\\n=== Russia ===\\nElizabeth continued to maintain the diplomatic relations with the <link>Tsardom of Russia</link> that were originally established by her half-brother, Edward VI. She often wrote to Tsar <link>Ivan the Terrible</link> on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather than on the possibility of a military alliance. Ivan even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardised. When this failed, he asked to marry <link>Mary Hastings</link>, which Elizabeth declined to speak to the Russian ambassador about. English merchant and explorer <link>Anthony Jenkinson</link>, who began his career as a representative of the <link>Muscovy Company</link>, became the Queen\\'s special ambassador to the court of Tsar Ivan.\\nUpon his death in 1584, Ivan was succeeded by his son <link>Feodor I</link>. Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm in maintaining exclusive trading rights with England. He declared his kingdom open to all foreigners, and dismissed the English ambassador <link>Jerome Bowes</link>, whose pomposity had been tolerated by Ivan. Elizabeth sent a new ambassador, Dr. Giles Fletcher, to demand from the regent <link>Boris Godunov</link> that he convince the Tsar to reconsider. The negotiations failed, due to Fletcher addressing Feodor with two of his many titles omitted. Elizabeth continued to appeal to Feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters. She proposed an alliance, something which she had refused to do when offered one by Feodor\\'s father, but was turned down.\\n\\n\\n=== Muslim states ===\\n\\nTrade and diplomatic relations developed between England and the <link>Barbary states</link> during the rule of Elizabeth. England established a trading relationship with Morocco in opposition to Spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for Moroccan sugar, in spite of a <link>papal</link> ban. In 1600, <link>Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud</link>, the principal secretary to the Moroccan ruler Mulai <link>Ahmad al-Mansur</link>, visited England as an ambassador to the English court, to negotiate an <link>Anglo-Moroccan alliance</link> against Spain. Elizabeth \"agreed to sell munitions supplies to Morocco, and she and Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur talked on and off about mounting a joint operation against the Spanish\". Discussions, however, remained inconclusive, and both rulers died within two years of the embassy.\\nDiplomatic relations were also established with the <link>Ottoman Empire</link> with the chartering of the <link>Levant Company</link> and the dispatch of the first English ambassador to the <link>Sublime Porte</link>, <link>William Harborne</link>, in 1578. For the first time, a treaty of commerce was signed in 1580. Numerous envoys were dispatched in both directions and epistolar exchanges occurred between Elizabeth and Sultan <link>Murad III</link>. In one correspondence, Murad entertained the notion that <link>Protestantism and Islam</link> had \"much more in common than either did with Roman Catholicism, as both rejected the worship of idols\", and argued for an alliance between England and the Ottoman Empire. To the dismay of Catholic Europe, England exported tin and lead (for cannon-casting) and munitions to the Ottoman Empire, and Elizabeth seriously discussed joint military operations with Murad III during the outbreak of war with Spain in 1585, as Francis Walsingham was lobbying for a direct Ottoman military involvement against the common Spanish enemy.\\n\\n\\n=== America ===\\nIn 1583, <link>Humphrey Gilbert</link> sailed west to establish a colony in <link>Newfoundland</link>. He never returned to England. Gilbert\\'s half-brother Walter Raleigh explored the Atlantic Coast and claimed the territory of <link>Virginia</link>, perhaps named in honour of Elizabeth, the \"Virgin Queen\". This territory was much larger than the present-day state of Virginia, extending from <link>New England</link> to the <link>Carolinas</link>. In 1585, Raleigh returned to Virginia with a small group of people. They landed on <link>Roanoke Island</link>, off present-day <link>North Carolina</link>. After the failure of the first colony, Raleigh recruited another group and put John White in command. When Raleigh returned in 1590, there was no trace of the <link>Roanoke Colony</link> he had left, but it was the first English settlement in North America.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>East India Company</link> ===\\nFollowing successful privateering against Spanish and Portuguese vessels, English voyagers travelled the globe in search of riches. As a result, London merchants presented a petition to Elizabeth with the aim of delivering a decisive blow to the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly of far-eastern trade. On 31 December 1600 the merchants received its charter from Elizabeth, and the East India Company was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region and China. James Lancaster commanded the first expedition the following year which was a success establishing its first factory at Bantum on <link>Java</link> in 1602. For a period of 15 years, the company was awarded a monopoly on English trade with all countries east of the <link>Cape of Good Hope</link> and west of the <link>Straits of Magellan</link>. The Company eventually controlled half of world trade and substantial territory in India in the 18th and 19th centuries.\\n\\n\\n== Later years ==\\nThe period after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 brought new difficulties for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign. The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. Prices rose and the <link>standard of living</link> fell. During this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic householders. To maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda. In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public\\'s affection for her.\\n\\nOne of the causes for this \"second reign\" of Elizabeth, as it is sometimes called, was the changed character of Elizabeth\\'s governing body, the privy council in the 1590s. A new generation was in power. With the exception of William Cecil, Baron Burghley, the most important politicians had died around 1590: the Earl of Leicester in 1588; Francis Walsingham in 1590; and <link>Christopher Hatton</link> in 1591. Factional strife in the government, which had not existed in a noteworthy form before the 1590s, now became its hallmark. A bitter rivalry arose between <link>Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex</link>, and Robert Cecil, son of Lord Burghley, with both being supported by their respective adherents. The struggle for the most powerful positions in the state marred the kingdom\\'s politics. The Queen\\'s personal authority was lessening, as is shown in the 1594 affair of Dr. <link>Roderigo Lopes</link>, her trusted physician. When he was wrongly accused by the Earl of Essex of <link>treason</link> out of personal pique, she could not prevent the doctor\\'s execution, although she had been angry about his arrest and seems not to have believed in his guilt.\\nDuring the last years of her reign, Elizabeth came to rely on the granting of monopolies as a cost-free system of patronage, rather than asking Parliament for more subsidies in a time of war. The practice soon led to <link>price-fixing</link>, the enrichment of courtiers at the public\\'s expense, and widespread resentment. This culminated in agitation in the House of Commons during the parliament of 1601. In her \"<link>Golden Speech</link>\" of 30 November 1601 at <link>Whitehall Palace</link> to a deputation of 140 members, Elizabeth professed ignorance of the abuses, and won the members over with promises and her usual appeal to the emotions:\\n\\nWho keeps their sovereign from the lapse of error, in which, by ignorance and not by intent they might have fallen, what thank they deserve, we know, though you may guess. And as nothing is more dear to us than the loving conservation of our subjects\\' hearts, what an undeserved doubt might we have incurred if the abusers of our liberality, the thrallers of our people, the wringers of the poor, had not been told us!\\n\\nThis same period of economic and political uncertainty, however, produced an unsurpassed literary flowering in England. The first signs of a new literary movement had appeared at the end of the second decade of Elizabeth\\'s reign, with <link>John Lyly</link>\\'s Euphues and Edmund Spenser\\'s <link>The Shepheardes Calender</link> in 1578. During the 1590s, some of the great names of <link>English literature</link> entered their maturity, including William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. Continuing into the <link>Jacobean era</link>, the English theatre would reach its peak. The notion of a great Elizabethan era depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth\\'s reign. They owed little directly to the Queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.\\nAs Elizabeth aged, her image gradually changed. She was portrayed as <link>Belphoebe</link> or <link>Astraea</link>, and after the Armada, as Gloriana, the eternally youthful <link>Faerie Queene</link> of Edmund Spenser\\'s poem. Elizabeth gave Edmund Spenser a pension; as this was unusual for her, it indicates that she liked his work. Her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic icons that made her look much younger than she was. In fact, her skin had been scarred by smallpox in 1562, leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics. Her love of sweets and fear of dentists contributed to severe tooth decay and loss to such an extent that foreign ambassadors had a hard time understanding her speech. André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from Henry IV of France, reported an audience with the Queen, during which he noticed, \"her teeth are very yellow and unequal ... and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly.\" Yet he added, \"her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal.\" Walter Raleigh called her \"a lady whom time had surprised\".\\n\\nThe more Elizabeth\\'s beauty faded, the more her courtiers praised it. Elizabeth was happy to play the part, but it is possible that in the last decade of her life she began to believe her own performance. She became fond and indulgent of the charming but petulant young Earl of Essex, who was Leicester\\'s stepson and took liberties with her for which she forgave him. She repeatedly appointed him to military posts despite his growing record of irresponsibility. After Essex\\'s desertion of his command in Ireland in 1599, Elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies. In February 1601, Essex tried to raise a rebellion in London. He intended to seize the Queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on 25 February. Elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were partly to blame for this turn of events. An observer wrote in 1602: \"Her delight is to sit in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears to bewail Essex.\"\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s senior adviser, Lord Burghley, died on 4 August 1598. His political mantle passed to his son Robert, who soon became the leader of the government. One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Robert Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret. He therefore entered into a coded negotiation with James VI of Scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim. Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and \"secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions\". The advice worked. James\\'s tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: \"So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort\". In historian <link>J. E. Neale</link>\\'s view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with \"unmistakable if veiled phrases\".\\n\\nThe Queen\\'s health remained fair until the autumn of 1602, when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. In February 1603, the death of <link>Catherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham</link>, the niece of her cousin and close friend Lady Knollys, came as a particular blow. In March, Elizabeth fell sick and remained in a \"settled and unremovable melancholy\", and sat motionless on a cushion for hours on end. When Robert Cecil told her that she must go to bed, she snapped: \"Must is not a word to use to princes, little man.\" She died on 24 March 1603 at <link>Richmond Palace</link>, between two and three in the morning. A few hours later, Cecil and the council set their plans in motion and proclaimed James king of England.\\nWhile it has become normative to record Elizabeth\\'s death as occurring in 1603, following English calendar reform in the 1750s, at the time England observed New Year\\'s Day on 25 March, commonly known as <link>Lady Day</link>. Thus Elizabeth died on the last day of the year 1602 in the old calendar. The modern convention is to use the old style calendar for the day and month while using the new style calendar for the year.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s coffin was carried downriver at night to Whitehall, on a barge lit with torches. At her funeral on 28 April, the coffin was taken to Westminster Abbey on a <link>hearse</link> drawn by four horses hung with black velvet. In the words of the chronicler <link>John Stow</link>:\\n\\nWestminster was surcharged with multitudes of all sorts of people in their streets, houses, windows, leads and gutters, that came out to see the <link>obsequy</link>, and when they beheld her statue lying upon the coffin, there was such a general sighing, groaning and weeping as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man.\\nElizabeth was interred in Westminster Abbey, in a tomb shared with her half-sister, <link>Mary I</link>. The Latin inscription on their tomb, \"Regno consortes & urna, hic obdormimus Elizabetha et Maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis\", translates to \"Consorts in realm and tomb, here we sleep, Elizabeth and Mary, sisters, in hope of resurrection\".\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\nElizabeth was lamented by many of her subjects, but others were relieved at her death. Expectations of King James started high but then declined. By the 1620s, there was a nostalgic revival of the cult of Elizabeth. Elizabeth was praised as a heroine of the Protestant cause and the ruler of a golden age. James was depicted as a Catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court. The triumphalist image that Elizabeth had cultivated towards the end of her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties, was taken at face value and her reputation inflated. <link>Godfrey Goodman</link>, Bishop of Gloucester, recalled: \"When we had experience of a Scottish government, the Queen did seem to revive. Then was her memory much magnified.\" Elizabeth\\'s reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance.\\nThe picture of Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers of the early 17th century has proved lasting and influential. Her memory was also revived during the <link>Napoleonic Wars</link>, when the nation again found itself on the brink of invasion. In the <link>Victorian era</link>, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the imperial ideology of the day, and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and <link>A. L. Rowse</link> (1950), interpreted Elizabeth\\'s reign as a golden age of progress. Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.\\nRecent historians, however, have taken a more complicated view of Elizabeth. Her reign is famous for the defeat of the Armada, and for successful raids against the Spaniards, such as those on Cádiz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. In Ireland, Elizabeth\\'s forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.\\nElizabeth established an English church that helped shape a national identity and remains in place today. Those who praised her later as a Protestant heroine overlooked her refusal to drop all practices of Catholic origin from the Church of England. Historians note that in her day, strict Protestants regarded the Acts of Settlement and Uniformity of 1559 as a compromise. In fact, Elizabeth believed that faith was personal and did not wish, as <link>Francis Bacon</link> put it, to \"make windows into men\\'s hearts and secret thoughts\".\\nThough Elizabeth followed a largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised England\\'s status abroad. \"She is only a woman, only mistress of half an island,\" marvelled <link>Pope Sixtus V</link>, \"and yet she makes herself feared by Spain, by France, by the Empire, by all\".  Under Elizabeth, the nation gained a new self-confidence and sense of sovereignty, as <link>Christendom</link> fragmented. Elizabeth was the first Tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent. She therefore always worked with parliament and advisers she could trust to tell her the truth—a style of government that her Stuart successors failed to follow. Some historians have called her lucky; she believed that God was protecting her. Priding herself on being \"mere English\", Elizabeth trusted in God, honest advice, and the love of her subjects for the success of her rule. In a prayer, she offered thanks to God that:\\n\\n[At a time] when wars and seditions with grievous persecutions have vexed almost all kings and countries round about me, my reign hath been peacable, and my realm a receptacle to thy afflicted Church. The love of my people hath appeared firm, and the devices of my enemies frustrate.\\n\\n\\n== Family tree ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n<link>Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom</link>\\n<link>Early modern Britain</link>\\n<link>English Renaissance</link>\\n<link>Inventory of Elizabeth I</link>\\n<link>Portraiture of Elizabeth I</link>\\n<link>Protestant Reformation</link>\\n<link>Royal Arms of England</link>\\n<link>Royal eponyms in Canada</link> for Queen Elizabeth I\\n<link>Royal Standards of England</link>\\n<link>Tudor period</link>\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== Citations ==\\n\\n\\n=== References ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nElizabeth I at the official website of the <link>British monarchy</link>\\nElizabeth I at the official website of the <link>Royal Collection Trust</link>\\nPortraits of Queen Elizabeth I at the <link>National Portrait Gallery, London</link> \\nWorks by Elizabeth I at <link>Project Gutenberg</link>\\nWorks by or about Elizabeth I at the <link>Internet Archive</link>\\nWorks by Elizabeth I at <link>LibriVox</link> (public domain audiobooks)', 'tool_call_id': 'call_mEqijDinHK9amB496OM1rIeG', 'name': 'get_content'}\n",

      "Concise Tool Response: Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 \n",
      "{'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 – 24 March 1603) was <link>Queen of England</link> and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death in 1603. She was the last and longest reigning monarch of the <link>House of Tudor</link>. Her eventful reign, and its effect on history and culture, gave name to the <link>Elizabethan era</link>.\\nElizabeth was the only surviving child of <link>Henry VIII</link> and his second wife, <link>Anne Boleyn</link>. When Elizabeth was two years old, her parents\\' marriage was <link>annulled</link>, her mother was executed, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Henry restored her to the line of succession when she was 10. After Henry\\'s death in 1547, Elizabeth\\'s younger half-brother <link>Edward VI</link> ruled until his own death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to a <link>Protestant</link> cousin, <link>Lady Jane Grey</link>, and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, despite statutes to the contrary. Edward\\'s will was quickly set aside and the <link>Catholic</link> Mary became queen, deposing Jane. During Mary\\'s reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\\nUpon Mary\\'s 1558 death, Elizabeth succeeded to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel. She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers led by William Cecil, whom she created <link>Baron Burghley</link>. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the <link>supreme governor</link>. This arrangement, later named the <link>Elizabethan Religious Settlement</link>, would evolve into the <link>Church of England</link>. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did. Because of this she is sometimes referred to as the \"Virgin Queen\". She was succeeded by her cousin, <link>James VI of Scotland</link>.\\nIn government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and siblings had been. One of her <link>mottoes</link> was video et taceo (\"I see and keep silent\"). In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570, which in theory released English Catholics from allegiance to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers\\' secret service, run by <link>Francis Walsingham</link>. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain. She half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. By the mid-1580s, England could no longer avoid war with Spain.\\nAs she grew older, Elizabeth became celebrated for her <link>virginity</link>. A <link>cult of personality</link> grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. The Elizabethan era is famous for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as <link>William Shakespeare</link> and <link>Christopher Marlowe</link>, the prowess of English maritime adventurers, such as <link>Francis Drake</link> and <link>Walter Raleigh</link>, and for the defeat of the <link>Spanish Armada</link>. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her fair share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer (\"<link>Gloriana</link>\") and a dogged survivor (\"Good Queen Bess\") in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. After the short, disastrous reigns of her half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped to forge a sense of national identity.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nElizabeth was born at <link>Greenwich Palace</link> on 7 September 1533 and was named after her grandmothers, <link>Elizabeth of York</link> and <link>Lady Elizabeth Howard</link>. She was the second child of <link>Henry VIII of England</link> born in wedlock to survive infancy. Her mother was Henry VIII\\'s second wife, Anne Boleyn. At birth, Elizabeth was the <link>heir presumptive</link> to the English throne. Her elder half-sister Mary had lost her position as a legitimate heir when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary\\'s mother, <link>Catherine of Aragon</link>, to marry Anne, with the intent to sire a male heir and ensure the Tudor succession. She was baptised on 10 September 1533, and her godparents were <link>Thomas Cranmer</link>, <link>Archbishop of Canterbury</link>; <link>Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter</link>; <link>Elizabeth Stafford, Duchess of Norfolk</link>; and <link>Margaret Wotton, Dowager Marchioness of Dorset</link>. A canopy was carried at the ceremony over the infant by her uncle <link>George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford</link>; <link>John Hussey, Baron Hussey of Sleaford</link>; <link>Lord Thomas Howard</link>; and <link>William Howard, Baron Howard of Effingham</link>.\\nElizabeth was two years and eight months old when her mother was beheaded on 19 May 1536, four months after Catherine of Aragon\\'s death from natural causes. Elizabeth was declared illegitimate and deprived of her place in the royal succession. Eleven days after Anne Boleyn\\'s execution, Henry married <link>Jane Seymour</link>. Queen Jane died the next year shortly after the birth of their son, Edward, who was the undisputed <link>heir apparent</link> to the throne. Elizabeth was placed in her half-brother\\'s household and carried the <link>chrisom</link>, or baptismal cloth, at his christening.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s first <link>governess</link>, <link>Margaret Bryan</link>, wrote that she was \"as toward a child and as gentle of conditions as ever I knew any in my life\". <link>Catherine Champernowne</link>, better known by her later, married name of Catherine \"Kat\" Ashley, was appointed as Elizabeth\\'s governess in 1537, and she remained Elizabeth\\'s friend until her death in 1565. Champernowne taught Elizabeth four languages: French, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish. By the time <link>William Grindal</link> became her tutor in 1544, Elizabeth could write English, <link>Latin</link>, and Italian. Under Grindal, a talented and skilful tutor, she also progressed in French and Greek. By the age of 12, she was able to translate her stepmother <link>Catherine Parr</link>\\'s religious work <link>Prayers or Meditations</link> from English into Italian, Latin, and French, which she presented to her father as a New Year\\'s gift. From her teenage years and throughout her life, she translated works in Latin and Greek by numerous classical authors, including the <link>Pro Marcello</link> of <link>Cicero</link>, the <link>De consolatione philosophiae</link> of <link>Boethius</link>, a treatise by <link>Plutarch</link>, and the Annals of <link>Tacitus</link>. A translation of Tacitus from <link>Lambeth Palace</link> Library, one of only four surviving English translations from the early modern era, was confirmed as Elizabeth\\'s own in 2019, after a detailed analysis of the handwriting and paper was undertaken.\\nAfter Grindal died in 1548, Elizabeth received her education under her brother Edward\\'s tutor, <link>Roger Ascham</link>, a sympathetic teacher who believed that learning should be engaging. Current knowledge of Elizabeth\\'s schooling and precocity comes largely from Ascham\\'s memoirs. By the time her formal education ended in 1550, Elizabeth was one of the best educated women of her generation. At the end of her life, she was believed to speak the Welsh, Cornish, Scottish, and <link>Irish language</link>s in addition to those mentioned above. The Venetian ambassador stated in 1603 that she \"possessed [these] languages so thoroughly that each appeared to be her native tongue\". Historian <link>Mark Stoyle</link> suggests that she was probably taught Cornish by William Killigrew, Groom of the Privy Chamber and later <link>Chamberlain of the Exchequer</link>.\\n\\n\\n== Thomas Seymour ==\\n\\nHenry VIII died in 1547 and Elizabeth\\'s half-brother, Edward VI, became king at the age of nine. Catherine Parr, Henry\\'s widow, soon married <link>Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley</link>, Edward VI\\'s uncle and the brother of Lord Protector <link>Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset</link>. The couple took Elizabeth into their household at Chelsea. There Elizabeth experienced an emotional crisis that some historians believe affected her for the rest of her life. Thomas Seymour engaged in romps and horseplay with the 14-year-old Elizabeth, including entering her bedroom in his nightgown, tickling her, and slapping her on the buttocks. Elizabeth rose early and surrounded herself with maids to avoid his unwelcome morning visits. Parr, rather than confront her husband over his inappropriate activities, joined in. Twice she accompanied him in tickling Elizabeth, and once held her while he cut her black gown \"into a thousand pieces\". However, after Parr discovered the pair in an embrace, she ended this state of affairs. In May 1548, Elizabeth was sent away.\\nThomas Seymour nevertheless continued scheming to control the royal family and tried to have himself appointed the governor of the King\\'s person. When Parr died after childbirth on 5 September 1548, he renewed his attentions towards Elizabeth, intent on marrying her. Her governess <link>Kat Ashley</link>, who was fond of Seymour, sought to convince Elizabeth to take him as her husband. She tried to convince Elizabeth to write to Seymour and \"comfort him in his sorrow\", but Elizabeth claimed that Thomas was not so saddened by her stepmother\\'s death as to need comfort.\\nIn January 1549, Seymour was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower on suspicion of conspiring to depose his brother Somerset as Protector, marry Lady <link>Jane Grey</link> to King Edward VI, and take Elizabeth as his own wife. Elizabeth, living at <link>Hatfield House</link>, would admit nothing. Her stubbornness exasperated her interrogator, Robert Tyrwhitt, who reported, \"I do see it in her face that she is guilty\". Seymour was beheaded on 20 March 1549.\\n\\n\\n== Reign of Mary ==\\n\\nEdward VI died on 6 July 1553, aged 15. His will ignored the <link>Succession to the Crown Act 1543</link>, excluded both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir Lady Jane Grey, granddaughter of Henry VIII\\'s younger sister <link>Mary Tudor, Queen of France</link>. Jane was proclaimed queen by the privy council, but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days. On 3 August 1553, Mary rode triumphantly into London, with Elizabeth at her side. The show of solidarity between the sisters did not last long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth outwardly conformed. Mary\\'s initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Philip of Spain, the son of <link>Holy Roman Emperor Charles V</link> and a Catholic. Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary\\'s religious policies.\\nIn January and February 1554, <link>Wyatt\\'s rebellion</link> broke out; it was soon suppressed. Elizabeth was brought to court and interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the <link>Tower of London</link>. Elizabeth fervently protested her innocence. Though it is unlikely that she had plotted with the rebels, some of them were known to have approached her. Mary\\'s closest confidant, Emperor Charles\\'s ambassador <link>Simon Renard</link>, argued that her throne would never be safe while Elizabeth lived; and Lord Chancellor <link>Stephen Gardiner</link>, worked to have Elizabeth put on trial. Elizabeth\\'s supporters in the government, including <link>William Paget, 1st Baron Paget</link>, convinced Mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. Instead, on 22 May, Elizabeth was moved from the Tower to <link>Woodstock Palace</link>, where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of <link>Henry Bedingfeld</link>. Crowds cheered her all along the way.\\nOn 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was recalled to court to attend the final stages of Mary\\'s apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen, but if Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth\\'s chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. When it became clear that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child. Elizabeth\\'s succession seemed assured.\\nKing Philip, who ascended the Spanish throne in 1556, acknowledged the new political reality and cultivated his sister-in-law. She was a better ally than the chief alternative, <link>Mary, Queen of Scots</link>, who had grown up in France and was betrothed to Francis, Dauphin of France. When his wife fell ill in 1558, Philip sent the Count of Feria to consult with Elizabeth. This interview was conducted at Hatfield House, where she had returned to live in October 1555. By October 1558, Elizabeth was already making plans for her government. Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir on 6 November 1558 and Elizabeth became queen when Mary died on 17 November.\\n\\n\\n== Accession ==\\n\\nElizabeth became queen at the age of 25, and declared her intentions to her council and other peers who had come to Hatfield to swear allegiance. The speech contains the first record of her adoption of the medieval <link>political theology</link> of the sovereign\\'s \"two bodies\": the body natural and the <link>body politic</link>:\\n\\nMy lords, the law of nature moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, considering I am God\\'s creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring from the bottom of my heart that I may have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me. And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all ... to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.\\nAs her <link>triumphal progress</link> wound through the city on the eve of the coronation ceremony, she was welcomed wholeheartedly by the citizens and greeted by orations and pageants, most with a strong Protestant flavour. Elizabeth\\'s open and gracious responses endeared her to the spectators, who were \"wonderfully ravished\". The following day, 15 January 1559, a date chosen by her astrologer <link>John Dee</link>, Elizabeth was crowned and anointed by <link>Owen Oglethorpe</link>, the Catholic <link>bishop of Carlisle</link>, in <link>Westminster Abbey</link>. She was then presented for the people\\'s acceptance, amidst a deafening noise of organs, fifes, trumpets, drums, and bells. Although Elizabeth was welcomed as queen in England, the country was still in a state of anxiety over the perceived Catholic threat at home and overseas, as well as the choice of whom she would marry.\\n\\n\\n== Church settlement ==\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s personal religious convictions have been much debated by scholars. She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the <link>crucifix</link>), and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief.\\nElizabeth and her advisers perceived the threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. The Queen therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants, but she would not tolerate the <link>Puritan</link>s, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the Parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as <link>vestments</link>.\\nThe House of Commons backed the proposals strongly, but the bill of supremacy met opposition in the <link>House of Lords</link>, particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the <link>Archbishopric of Canterbury</link>. This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of <link>Supreme Governor of the Church of England</link> rather than the more contentious title of <link>Supreme Head</link>, which many thought unacceptable for a woman to bear. The new Act of Supremacy became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were forced to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the <link>heresy</link> laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters by Mary. At the same time, a new Act of Uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of the 1559 <link>Book of Common Prayer</link> (an adapted version of the <link>1552 prayer book</link>) compulsory, though the penalties for <link>recusancy</link>, or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.\\n\\n\\n== Marriage question ==\\nFrom the start of Elizabeth\\'s reign it was expected that she would marry, and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers, she never married and remained childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships. She considered several suitors until she was about 50 years old. Her last courtship was with <link>Francis, Duke of Anjou</link>, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King <link>Philip II of Spain</link>, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.\\n\\n\\n=== Robert Dudley ===\\n\\nIn the spring of 1559, it became evident that Elizabeth was in love with her childhood friend Robert Dudley. It was said that his wife Amy was suffering from a \"malady in one of her breasts\" and that the Queen would like to marry Robert if his wife should die. By the autumn of 1559, several foreign suitors were vying for Elizabeth\\'s hand; their impatient envoys engaged in ever more scandalous talk and reported that a marriage with her <link>favourite</link> was not welcome in England: \"There is not a man who does not cry out on him and her with indignation ... she will marry none but the favoured Robert.\" Amy Dudley died in September 1560, from a fall from a flight of stairs and, despite the <link>coroner</link>\\'s <link>inquest</link> finding of accident, many people suspected her husband of having arranged her death so that he could marry the Queen. Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley for some time. However, William Cecil, <link>Nicholas Throckmorton</link>, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear. There were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place.\\nAmong other marriage candidates being considered for the queen, Robert Dudley continued to be regarded as a possible candidate for nearly another decade. Elizabeth was extremely jealous of his affections, even when she no longer meant to marry him herself. She raised Dudley to the peerage as <link>Earl of Leicester</link> in 1564. In 1578, he finally married <link>Lettice Knollys</link>, to whom the queen reacted with repeated scenes of displeasure and lifelong hatred. Still, Dudley always \"remained at the centre of [Elizabeth\\'s] emotional life\", as historian <link>Susan Doran</link> has described the situation. He died shortly after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. After Elizabeth\\'s own death, a note from him was found among her most personal belongings, marked \"his last letter\" in her handwriting.\\n\\n\\n=== Foreign candidates ===\\nMarriage negotiations constituted a key element in Elizabeth\\'s foreign policy. She turned down the hand of Philip, her half-sister\\'s widower, early in 1559 but for several years entertained the proposal of King <link>Eric XIV of Sweden</link>. Earlier in Elizabeth\\'s life, a Danish match for her had been discussed; Henry VIII had proposed one with the Danish prince <link>Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp</link>, in 1545, and Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, suggested a marriage with Prince Frederick (later Frederick II) several years later, but the negotiations had abated in 1551. In the years around 1559, a Dano-English Protestant alliance was considered, and to counter Sweden\\'s proposal, King Frederick II proposed to Elizabeth in late 1559.\\n\\nFor several years, she seriously negotiated to marry Philip\\'s cousin <link>Charles II, Archduke of Austria</link>. By 1569, relations with the <link>Habsburgs</link> had deteriorated. Elizabeth considered marriage to two French Valois princes in turn, first <link>Henry, Duke of Anjou</link>, and then from 1572 to 1581 his brother Francis, Duke of Anjou, formerly Duke of Alençon. This last proposal was tied to a planned alliance against Spanish control of the <link>Southern Netherlands</link>. Elizabeth seems to have taken the courtship seriously for a time, wearing a frog-shaped earring that Francis had sent her.\\nIn 1563, Elizabeth told an imperial envoy: \"If I follow the inclination of my nature, it is this: beggar-woman and single, far rather than queen and married\". Later in the year, following Elizabeth\\'s illness with <link>smallpox</link>, the succession question became a heated issue in Parliament. Members urged the Queen to marry or nominate an heir, to prevent a civil war upon her death. She refused to do either. In April she prorogued the Parliament, which did not reconvene until she needed its support to raise taxes in 1566.\\nHaving previously promised to marry, she told an unruly House:\\n\\nI will never break the word of a prince spoken in public place, for my honour\\'s sake. And therefore I say again, I will marry as soon as I can conveniently, if God take not him away with whom I mind to marry, or myself, or else some other great let [obstruction] happen.\\nBy 1570, senior figures in the government privately accepted that Elizabeth would never marry or name a successor. William Cecil was already seeking solutions to the succession problem. For her failure to marry, Elizabeth was often accused of irresponsibility. Her silence, however, strengthened her own political security: she knew that if she named an heir, her throne would be vulnerable to a coup; she remembered the way that \"a second person, as I have been\" had been used as the focus of plots against her predecessor.\\n\\n\\n=== Virginity ===\\nElizabeth\\'s unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity related to that of the Virgin Mary. In poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin, a goddess, or both, not as a normal woman. At first, only Elizabeth made a virtue of her ostensible virginity: in 1559, she told the Commons, \"And, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin\". Later on, poets and writers took up the theme and developed an <link>iconography</link> that exalted Elizabeth. Public tributes to the Virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queen\\'s marriage negotiations with the Duke of Alençon. Ultimately, Elizabeth would insist she was married to her kingdom and subjects, under divine protection. In 1599, she spoke of \"all my husbands, my good people\".\\n\\nThis claim of virginity was not universally accepted. Catholics accused Elizabeth of engaging in \"filthy lust\" that symbolically defiled the nation along with her body. <link>Henry IV of France</link> said that one of the great questions of Europe was \"whether Queen Elizabeth was a maid or no\".\\nA central issue, when it comes to the question of Elizabeth\\'s virginity, was whether the Queen ever consummated her love affair with Robert Dudley. In 1559, she had Dudley\\'s bedchambers moved next to her own apartments. In 1561, she was mysteriously bedridden with an illness that caused her body to swell.\\nIn 1587, a young man calling himself <link>Arthur Dudley</link> was arrested on the coast of Spain under suspicion of being a spy. The man claimed to be the illegitimate son of Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, with his age being consistent with birth during the 1561 illness. He was taken to <link>Madrid</link> for investigation, where he was examined by <link>Francis Englefield</link>, a Catholic aristocrat exiled to Spain and secretary to King Philip II. Three letters exist today describing the interview, detailing what Arthur proclaimed to be the story of his life, from birth in the royal palace to the time of his arrival in Spain. However, this failed to convince the Spaniards: Englefield admitted to King Philip that Arthur\\'s \"claim at present amounts to nothing\", but suggested that \"he should not be allowed to get away, but [...] kept very secure.\" The King agreed, and Arthur was never heard from again. Modern scholarship dismisses the story\\'s basic premise as \"impossible\", and asserts that Elizabeth\\'s life was so closely observed by contemporaries that she could not have hidden a pregnancy.\\n\\n\\n== Mary, Queen of Scots ==\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s first policy toward Scotland was to oppose the French presence there. She feared that the French planned to invade England and put her Catholic cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. Mary was considered by many to be the heir to the English crown, being the granddaughter of Henry VIII\\'s elder sister, Margaret. Mary boasted being \"the nearest kinswoman she hath\". Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting <link>Treaty of Edinburgh</link> of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north. When Mary returned from France to Scotland in 1561 to take up the reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was run by a council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth. Mary refused to ratify the treaty.\\nIn 1563, Elizabeth proposed her own suitor, Robert Dudley, as a husband for Mary, without asking either of the two people concerned. Both proved unenthusiastic, and in 1565, Mary married <link>Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley</link>, who carried his own claim to the English throne. The marriage was the first of a series of errors of judgement by Mary that handed the victory to the Scottish Protestants and to Elizabeth. Darnley quickly became unpopular and was murdered in February 1567 by conspirators almost certainly led by <link>James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell</link>. Shortly afterwards, on 15 May 1567, Mary married Bothwell, arousing suspicions that she had been party to the murder of her husband. Elizabeth confronted Mary about the marriage, writing to her:\\n\\nHow could a worse choice be made for your honour than in such haste to marry such a subject, who besides other and notorious lacks, public fame has charged with the murder of your late husband, besides the touching of yourself also in some part, though we trust in that behalf falsely.\\nThese events led rapidly to Mary\\'s defeat and imprisonment in <link>Lochleven Castle</link>. The Scottish lords forced her to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son, <link>James VI</link>. James was taken to <link>Stirling Castle</link> to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped in 1568 but after a defeat at Langside sailed to England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth\\'s first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch, but she and her council instead chose to play safe. Rather than risk returning Mary to Scotland with an English army or sending her to France and the Catholic enemies of England, they detained her in England, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.\\n\\n\\n=== Catholic cause ===\\n\\nMary was soon the focus for rebellion. In 1569 there was a major Catholic rising in the North; the goal was to free Mary, marry her to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and put her on the English throne. After the rebels\\' defeat, over 750 of them were executed on Elizabeth\\'s orders. In the belief that the revolt had been successful, <link>Pope Pius V</link> issued a bull in 1570, titled <link>Regnans in Excelsis</link>, which declared \"Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime\" to be excommunicated and a <link>heretic</link>, releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her. Catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with <link>excommunication</link>. The <link>papal bull</link> provoked legislative initiatives against Catholics by Parliament, which were, however, mitigated by Elizabeth\\'s intervention. In 1581, to convert English subjects to Catholicism with \"the intent\" to withdraw them from their allegiance to Elizabeth was made a treasonable offence, carrying the death penalty. From the 1570s <link>missionary</link> priests from continental <link>seminaries</link> went to England secretly in the cause of the \"reconversion of England\". Some were executed for treasonable conduct, engendering a cult of <link>martyrdom</link>.\\nRegnans in Excelsis gave English Catholics a strong incentive to look to Mary as the legitimate sovereign of England. Mary may not have been told of every Catholic plot to put her on the English throne, but from the <link>Ridolfi Plot</link> of 1571 (which caused Mary\\'s suitor, the Duke of Norfolk, to lose his head) to the <link>Babington Plot</link> of 1586, Elizabeth\\'s <link>spymaster</link> Francis Walsingham and the royal council keenly assembled a case against her. At first, Elizabeth resisted calls for Mary\\'s death. By late 1586, she had been persuaded to sanction Mary\\'s trial and execution on the evidence of letters written during the Babington Plot. Elizabeth\\'s proclamation of the sentence announced that \"the said Mary, pretending title to the same Crown, had compassed and imagined within the same realm diverse things tending to the hurt, death and destruction of our royal person.\" On 8 February 1587, Mary was beheaded at <link>Fotheringhay Castle</link>, Northamptonshire. After the execution, Elizabeth claimed that she had not intended for the signed execution warrant to be dispatched, and blamed her secretary, William Davison, for implementing it without her knowledge. The sincerity of Elizabeth\\'s remorse and whether or not she wanted to delay the warrant have been called into question both by her contemporaries and later historians.\\n\\n\\n== Wars ==\\nElizabeth\\'s foreign policy was largely defensive. The exception was the English occupation of <link>Le Havre</link> from October 1562 to June 1563, which ended in failure when Elizabeth\\'s <link>Huguenot</link> allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port. Elizabeth\\'s intention had been to exchange Le Havre for Calais, lost to France in January 1558. Only through the activities of her fleets did Elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy. This paid off in the war against Spain, 80% of which was fought at sea. She knighted Francis Drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from 1577 to 1580, and he won fame for his raids on Spanish ports and fleets. An element of <link>piracy</link> and self-enrichment drove Elizabethan seafarers, over whom the Queen had little control.\\n\\n\\n=== Netherlands ===\\n\\nAfter the occupation and loss of Le Havre in 1562–1563, Elizabeth avoided military expeditions on the continent until 1585, when she sent an English army to aid the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip II. This followed the deaths in 1584 of the Queen\\'s allies <link>William the Silent</link>, Prince of Orange, and the Duke of Anjou, and the surrender of a series of Dutch towns to <link>Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma</link>, Philip\\'s governor of the <link>Spanish Netherlands</link>. In December 1584, an alliance between Philip II and the French Catholic League at Joinville undermined the ability of Anjou\\'s brother, <link>Henry III of France</link>, to counter Spanish domination of the Netherlands. It also extended Spanish influence along the channel coast of France, where the Catholic League was strong, and exposed England to invasion. The siege of Antwerp in the summer of 1585 by the Duke of Parma necessitated some reaction on the part of the English and the Dutch. The outcome was the <link>Treaty of Nonsuch</link> of August 1585, in which Elizabeth promised military support to the Dutch. The treaty marked the beginning of the Anglo-Spanish War.\\nThe expedition was led by Elizabeth\\'s former suitor, the Earl of Leicester. Elizabeth from the start did not really back this course of action. Her strategy, to support the Dutch on the surface with an English army, while beginning secret peace talks with Spain within days of Leicester\\'s arrival in Holland, had necessarily to be at odds with Leicester\\'s, who had set up a protectorate and was expected by the Dutch to fight an active campaign. Elizabeth, on the other hand, wanted him \"to avoid at all costs any decisive action with the enemy\". He enraged Elizabeth by accepting the post of Governor-General from the <link>Dutch States General</link>. Elizabeth saw this as a Dutch ploy to force her to accept sovereignty over the Netherlands, which so far she had always declined. She wrote to Leicester:\\n\\nWe could never have imagined (had we not seen it fall out in experience) that a man raised up by ourself and extraordinarily favoured by us, above any other subject of this land, would have in so contemptible a sort broken our commandment in a cause that so greatly touches us in honour ... And therefore our express pleasure and commandment is that, all delays and excuses laid apart, you do presently upon the duty of your allegiance obey and fulfill whatsoever the bearer hereof shall direct you to do in our name. Whereof fail you not, as you will answer the contrary at your utmost peril.\\nElizabeth\\'s \"commandment\" was that her emissary read out her letters of disapproval publicly before the Dutch Council of State, Leicester having to stand nearby. This public humiliation of her \"Lieutenant-General\" combined with her continued talks for a separate peace with Spain irreversibly undermined Leicester\\'s standing among the Dutch. The military campaign was severely hampered by Elizabeth\\'s repeated refusals to send promised funds for her starving soldiers. Her unwillingness to commit herself to the cause, Leicester\\'s own shortcomings as a political and military leader, and the faction-ridden and chaotic situation of Dutch politics led to the failure of the campaign. Leicester finally resigned his command in December 1587. The Spanish still controlled the southern provinces of the Netherlands, and the threat of the invasion of England remained.\\nSupport for the Dutch nevertheless continued. Leicester\\'s replacement was <link>Francis Vere</link> who became sergeant major-general of all Elizabeth\\'s troops in the Low Countries by 1589. This was a position he retained during fifteen campaigns with almost unbroken success. Vere enjoyed excellent relations with the Dutch under <link>Maurice of Nassau</link>, and worked in close co-operation with them to help secure the country for the cause of independence. Vere\\'s troops shattered the myth of Spanish invincibility, and he thus secured Elizabeth\\'s respect and admiration. English support for the Dutch finished after Elizabeth\\'s death, but by that time the Dutch were strong enough to hold their own.\\n\\n\\n=== Spain ===\\n\\nWith England at war with Spain in 1585, Francis Drake undertook a year long voyage raiding Spanish ports and ships in the <link>Caribbean</link>. In 1587 he made a successful raid on <link>Cádiz</link>, destroying the Spanish fleet of war ships intended for the Enterprise of England, as Philip II had decided to take the war to England.\\nOn 12 July 1588, the Spanish Armada, a great fleet of ships, set sail for the channel, planning to ferry a Spanish invasion force under the Duke of Parma to the coast of southeast England from the Netherlands. To intercept the Armada, Elizabeth sent her navy led by Francis Drake and Charles Howard. The armada was defeated by a combination of miscalculation, misfortune, and an attack of English <link>fire ships</link> off <link>Gravelines</link> at midnight on 28–29 July (7–8 August New Style), which dispersed the Spanish ships to the northeast. The Armada straggled home to Spain in shattered remnants, after disastrous losses on the coast of Ireland (after some ships had tried to struggle back to Spain via the <link>North Sea</link>, and then back south past the west coast of Ireland). Unaware of the Armada\\'s fate, English militias mustered to defend the country under the Earl of Leicester\\'s command. Leicester invited Elizabeth to inspect her troops at <link>Tilbury</link> in Essex on 8 August. Wearing a silver breastplate over a white velvet dress, she addressed them in her <link>Speech to the Troops at Tilbury</link>:\\n\\nMy loving people, we have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you, I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people ... I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.\\n\\nWhen no invasion came, the nation rejoiced. Elizabeth\\'s procession to a thanksgiving service at St Paul\\'s Cathedral rivalled that of her coronation as a spectacle. The defeat of the armada was a potent propaganda victory, both for Elizabeth and for Protestant England. The English took their delivery as a symbol of God\\'s favour and of the nation\\'s inviolability under a virgin queen. However, the victory was not a turning point in the war, which continued for another sixteen years.\\nIn 1589, the year after the Spanish Armada, Elizabeth sent to Spain the <link>English Armada</link> or Counter Armada with 23,375 men and 150 ships, led by Francis Drake as admiral and John Norreys as general. The English fleet suffered a catastrophic defeat with 11,000–15,000 killed, wounded or died of disease and 40 ships sunk or captured. The advantage England had won upon the destruction of the Spanish Armada was lost, and the Spanish victory marked a revival of Philip II\\'s naval power through the next decade.\\nWhile the English navy kept an eye on the next invasion, it was left for English privateers to see to the hunt for Spanish and Portuguese treasure ships. They would take part in highly lucrative joint stock expeditions to raid and plunder settlements and shipping in the Atlantic and on the Spanish Main. Known as <link>Elizabethan Sea Dogs</link>; they included the likes of Drake, Hawkins and Raleigh. Elizabeth\\'s court and powerful London merchants were at the forefront of promoting, equipping and financing these expeditions, which were authorized by Elizabeth. She alone would receive nearly a third of the profits, which in addition filled her realm\\'s coffers. One of the most notable prizes was a large and highly valuable Portuguese <link>Carrack</link>, the <link>Madre de Deus</link> which was taken in battle off the Azores in 1592. It was subject to mass theft after arrival in Dartmouth, which angered Elizabeth, but even so the rest of the cargo was still half the wealth of the English treasury at the time.\\nThere were a number of failures; the most notable being Drake and Hawkins on a disastrous expedition to the Caribbean in 1595 during which both died, the news of which shocked Elizabeth. Despite this, a new breed of Sea Dogs came to fruition, the likes of <link>James Lancaster</link>, William Parker and the most successful of all <link>Christopher Newport</link>. Although they failed to capture any of the major treasure ships, Elizabeth\\'s \\'Sea Dogs\\' were highly successful; a strategy of harassment brought in an average of 15% of nation\\'s imports every year throughout the war.\\nIn 1596 Elizabeth sent the second English armada to Cádiz, in the hope of seizing the treasure fleet. Led by her favorite the Earl of Essex, Elizabeth\\'s fleet with Dutch support, succeeded in capturing Cádiz costing the Spanish some 32 ships sunk along with the treasure in them. The victory was hailed as a triumph, and Essex became a hero - his prestige rivalling Elizabeth\\'s. The Queen accused Essex of pilfering Spanish treasure, and questioned why he had dished out knighthoods whilst in Cádiz, reminding him he had no authority to do so.\\nMeanwhile, in revenge for Cádiz, Philip II sent his <link>second Spanish Armada</link> to England a few months later, but this met with disaster - storms swept away the fleet before it saw sight of England, costing nearly 5,000 men and 40 ships sunk. This, along with the Cádiz raid forced Spain to declare bankruptcy that year. Undeterred, Philip sent the <link>third Armada</link> in 1597, but near the English coast another storm dispersed the fleet, losing another 28 ships sunk or captured and 2,000 men. Elizabeth awarded Charles Howard the title of the <link>Earl of Nottingham</link> for his performance during the campaign. The Queen nevertheless was furious with the Earl of Essex who had been away on a failed expedition to the Azores, accusing him of making England defenseless – their relationship became ever more strained.\\nAfter the death of Philip II in 1598, his successor Philip III built up his fleet once more and sent the <link>fourth Spanish Armada</link> to Ireland in 1601 to assist the rebels there. The Spanish this time made landfall and held the town of <link>Kinsale</link> for three months but following the defeat of the rebels outside the town the Spanish were forced to surrender their entire force along the Southwest Irish coast. This defeat weakened Spanish resolve in the war against England; both sides were nevertheless exhausted and peace was signed between England and Spain with the Treaty of London in 1604, a year after Elizabeth\\'s death.\\nWalter Raleigh claimed after her death that Elizabeth\\'s caution had impeded the war against Spain:\\n\\nIf the late queen would have believed her men of war as she did her scribes, we had in her time beaten that great empire in pieces and made their kings of figs and oranges as in old times. But her Majesty did all by halves, and by petty invasions taught the Spaniard how to defend himself, and to see his own weakness.\\nThough some historians have criticised Elizabeth on similar grounds, Elizabeth had good reason not to place too much trust in her commanders, who once in action tended, as she put it herself, \"to be transported with an haviour of vainglory\".\\n\\n\\n=== France ===\\n\\nWhen the Protestant Henry IV inherited the French throne in 1589, Elizabeth sent him military support. It was her first venture into France since the retreat from Le Havre in 1563. Henry\\'s succession was strongly contested by the Catholic League and by Philip II, and Elizabeth feared a Spanish takeover of the channel ports.\\nThe subsequent early English campaigns in France, however, were disorganised and ineffective. Peregrine Bertie, largely ignoring Elizabeth\\'s orders, roamed northern France to little effect, with an army of 4,000 men. He withdrew in disarray in December 1590 following the failure of the Siege of Paris. The following year, John Norreys, led 3,000 men to campaign in Brittany, which despite victory at Quenelec in June ended inconclusively.\\nIn July, Elizabeth sent out another force under <link>Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex</link>, to help Henry IV in besieging Rouen which Norreys joined. Essex however accomplished nothing and returned home in January 1592, and Henry abandoned the siege in April. As usual, Elizabeth lacked control over her commanders once they were abroad. \"Where he is, or what he doth, or what he is to do,\" she wrote of Essex, \"we are ignorant\". Norreys left for London to plead in person for more support. Elizabeth dithered, and in Norreys\\' absence in May 1592, a Catholic League and Spanish army almost destroyed the remains of his army at Craon, north-west France. As for all such expeditions, Elizabeth was unwilling to invest in the supplies and reinforcements requested by the commanders.\\nIn March 1593, Henry converted to Catholicism in Paris to secure his hold on the French crown. Elizabeth was distraught and shocked at this move, and she resented any further attempts by Henry to win her over and ordered all of her forces home. Despite this, the Catholic leaguers did not trust Henry and still opposed him - their Spanish allies meanwhile continued to campaign in Brittany and advanced on the major port of Brest. King Philip of Spain was intent on establishing advanced bases in western France from which his rebuilt navy could constantly threaten England. Norreys wrote to Elizabeth warning her about this threat - and after some hesitation saw the danger and so sent another force in 1594. Norreys with 4,000 men worked with his French counterpart <link>Jean VI d\\'Aumont</link>. This time success was achieved; after taking a number of towns, they laid siege to an encroaching Spanish fort near Brest which was overrun and destroyed. This was a decisive victory ending the threat, and not long after the Catholic league collapsed. Elizabeth hailed Norreys a hero, but then ordered him back to England along with his troops.\\nIn 1595 Henry declared war on Spain and wanted England to form an alliance with France. Elizabeth however was not interested, owing to her mistrust of Henry and the fear that France was becoming more dominant. The Spanish however captured Calais in 1596, and with Spain now in sight of England once more, Elizabeth relented – the triple alliance was formed along with the <link>Dutch Republic</link>. Elizabeth however still hesitated, attempting to barter for either Boulogne or an indemnity in money, the latter of which was agreed. When Spanish forces seized <link>Amiens</link> in March 1597, Elizabeth sent a force of some 4,200 men under Thomas Baskerville to Picardy, joining Henry\\'s forces. The Anglo-French force arrived, then besieged Amiens and drove off a relief army. The town then surrendered, following which French overtures for peace with Spain began. Henry wanted Elizabeth to be part of this peace but she refused, reminding him of the alliance with the Dutch. Henry ultimately went behind Elizabeth\\'s back to sign the peace with Spain at Vervins. She thus accused the French king of \\'perfidy and double-dealing\\'.\\n\\n\\n=== Ireland ===\\n\\nAlthough Ireland was one of her two kingdoms, Elizabeth faced a hostile, and in places virtually autonomous, Irish population that adhered to Catholicism and was willing to defy her authority and plot with her enemies. Her policy there was to grant land to her <link>courtiers</link> and prevent the rebels from giving Spain a base from which to attack England. In the course of a series of uprisings, Crown forces pursued <link>scorched-earth</link> tactics, burning the land and slaughtering man, woman and child. During a revolt in <link>Munster</link> led by Gerald FitzGerald, Earl of Desmond, in 1582, an estimated 30,000 Irish people starved to death. The poet and colonist <link>Edmund Spenser</link> wrote that the victims \"were brought to such wretchedness as that any stony heart would have rued the same\". Elizabeth advised her commanders that the Irish, \"that rude and barbarous nation\", be well treated, but she or her commanders showed no remorse when force and bloodshed served their authoritarian purpose.\\nBetween 1593 and 1603, Elizabeth faced her most severe test in Ireland during the Nine Years\\' War, a revolt that took place at the height of hostilities with Spain, who backed the rebel leader, <link>Hugh O\\'Neill, Earl of Tyrone</link>. In spring 1599, Elizabeth sent Robert Devereux to put the revolt down. To her frustration, he made little progress and returned to England in defiance of her orders. He was replaced by Charles Blount, who within three years defeated the rebels who were supported by the Spanish. The decisive battle took place at Kinsale in 1602; Elizabeth lauded the victory, hailing Mountjoy a hero. The financial cost of the Irish war however was considerable and Elizabeth\\'s realm only just avoided bankruptcy. O\\'Neill finally surrendered in 1603 at the <link>Treaty of Mellifont</link>, a few days after Elizabeth\\'s death.\\n\\n\\n== Overseas trade ==\\n\\n\\n=== Russia ===\\nElizabeth continued to maintain the diplomatic relations with the <link>Tsardom of Russia</link> that were originally established by her half-brother, Edward VI. She often wrote to Tsar <link>Ivan the Terrible</link> on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather than on the possibility of a military alliance. Ivan even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardised. When this failed, he asked to marry <link>Mary Hastings</link>, which Elizabeth declined to speak to the Russian ambassador about. English merchant and explorer <link>Anthony Jenkinson</link>, who began his career as a representative of the <link>Muscovy Company</link>, became the Queen\\'s special ambassador to the court of Tsar Ivan.\\nUpon his death in 1584, Ivan was succeeded by his son <link>Feodor I</link>. Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm in maintaining exclusive trading rights with England. He declared his kingdom open to all foreigners, and dismissed the English ambassador <link>Jerome Bowes</link>, whose pomposity had been tolerated by Ivan. Elizabeth sent a new ambassador, Dr. Giles Fletcher, to demand from the regent <link>Boris Godunov</link> that he convince the Tsar to reconsider. The negotiations failed, due to Fletcher addressing Feodor with two of his many titles omitted. Elizabeth continued to appeal to Feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters. She proposed an alliance, something which she had refused to do when offered one by Feodor\\'s father, but was turned down.\\n\\n\\n=== Muslim states ===\\n\\nTrade and diplomatic relations developed between England and the <link>Barbary states</link> during the rule of Elizabeth. England established a trading relationship with Morocco in opposition to Spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for Moroccan sugar, in spite of a <link>papal</link> ban. In 1600, <link>Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud</link>, the principal secretary to the Moroccan ruler Mulai <link>Ahmad al-Mansur</link>, visited England as an ambassador to the English court, to negotiate an <link>Anglo-Moroccan alliance</link> against Spain. Elizabeth \"agreed to sell munitions supplies to Morocco, and she and Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur talked on and off about mounting a joint operation against the Spanish\". Discussions, however, remained inconclusive, and both rulers died within two years of the embassy.\\nDiplomatic relations were also established with the <link>Ottoman Empire</link> with the chartering of the <link>Levant Company</link> and the dispatch of the first English ambassador to the <link>Sublime Porte</link>, <link>William Harborne</link>, in 1578. For the first time, a treaty of commerce was signed in 1580. Numerous envoys were dispatched in both directions and epistolar exchanges occurred between Elizabeth and Sultan <link>Murad III</link>. In one correspondence, Murad entertained the notion that <link>Protestantism and Islam</link> had \"much more in common than either did with Roman Catholicism, as both rejected the worship of idols\", and argued for an alliance between England and the Ottoman Empire. To the dismay of Catholic Europe, England exported tin and lead (for cannon-casting) and munitions to the Ottoman Empire, and Elizabeth seriously discussed joint military operations with Murad III during the outbreak of war with Spain in 1585, as Francis Walsingham was lobbying for a direct Ottoman military involvement against the common Spanish enemy.\\n\\n\\n=== America ===\\nIn 1583, <link>Humphrey Gilbert</link> sailed west to establish a colony in <link>Newfoundland</link>. He never returned to England. Gilbert\\'s half-brother Walter Raleigh explored the Atlantic Coast and claimed the territory of <link>Virginia</link>, perhaps named in honour of Elizabeth, the \"Virgin Queen\". This territory was much larger than the present-day state of Virginia, extending from <link>New England</link> to the <link>Carolinas</link>. In 1585, Raleigh returned to Virginia with a small group of people. They landed on <link>Roanoke Island</link>, off present-day <link>North Carolina</link>. After the failure of the first colony, Raleigh recruited another group and put John White in command. When Raleigh returned in 1590, there was no trace of the <link>Roanoke Colony</link> he had left, but it was the first English settlement in North America.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>East India Company</link> ===\\nFollowing successful privateering against Spanish and Portuguese vessels, English voyagers travelled the globe in search of riches. As a result, London merchants presented a petition to Elizabeth with the aim of delivering a decisive blow to the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly of far-eastern trade. On 31 December 1600 the merchants received its charter from Elizabeth, and the East India Company was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region and China. James Lancaster commanded the first expedition the following year which was a success establishing its first factory at Bantum on <link>Java</link> in 1602. For a period of 15 years, the company was awarded a monopoly on English trade with all countries east of the <link>Cape of Good Hope</link> and west of the <link>Straits of Magellan</link>. The Company eventually controlled half of world trade and substantial territory in India in the 18th and 19th centuries.\\n\\n\\n== Later years ==\\nThe period after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 brought new difficulties for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign. The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. Prices rose and the <link>standard of living</link> fell. During this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic householders. To maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda. In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public\\'s affection for her.\\n\\nOne of the causes for this \"second reign\" of Elizabeth, as it is sometimes called, was the changed character of Elizabeth\\'s governing body, the privy council in the 1590s. A new generation was in power. With the exception of William Cecil, Baron Burghley, the most important politicians had died around 1590: the Earl of Leicester in 1588; Francis Walsingham in 1590; and <link>Christopher Hatton</link> in 1591. Factional strife in the government, which had not existed in a noteworthy form before the 1590s, now became its hallmark. A bitter rivalry arose between <link>Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex</link>, and Robert Cecil, son of Lord Burghley, with both being supported by their respective adherents. The struggle for the most powerful positions in the state marred the kingdom\\'s politics. The Queen\\'s personal authority was lessening, as is shown in the 1594 affair of Dr. <link>Roderigo Lopes</link>, her trusted physician. When he was wrongly accused by the Earl of Essex of <link>treason</link> out of personal pique, she could not prevent the doctor\\'s execution, although she had been angry about his arrest and seems not to have believed in his guilt.\\nDuring the last years of her reign, Elizabeth came to rely on the granting of monopolies as a cost-free system of patronage, rather than asking Parliament for more subsidies in a time of war. The practice soon led to <link>price-fixing</link>, the enrichment of courtiers at the public\\'s expense, and widespread resentment. This culminated in agitation in the House of Commons during the parliament of 1601. In her \"<link>Golden Speech</link>\" of 30 November 1601 at <link>Whitehall Palace</link> to a deputation of 140 members, Elizabeth professed ignorance of the abuses, and won the members over with promises and her usual appeal to the emotions:\\n\\nWho keeps their sovereign from the lapse of error, in which, by ignorance and not by intent they might have fallen, what thank they deserve, we know, though you may guess. And as nothing is more dear to us than the loving conservation of our subjects\\' hearts, what an undeserved doubt might we have incurred if the abusers of our liberality, the thrallers of our people, the wringers of the poor, had not been told us!\\n\\nThis same period of economic and political uncertainty, however, produced an unsurpassed literary flowering in England. The first signs of a new literary movement had appeared at the end of the second decade of Elizabeth\\'s reign, with <link>John Lyly</link>\\'s Euphues and Edmund Spenser\\'s <link>The Shepheardes Calender</link> in 1578. During the 1590s, some of the great names of <link>English literature</link> entered their maturity, including William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. Continuing into the <link>Jacobean era</link>, the English theatre would reach its peak. The notion of a great Elizabethan era depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth\\'s reign. They owed little directly to the Queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.\\nAs Elizabeth aged, her image gradually changed. She was portrayed as <link>Belphoebe</link> or <link>Astraea</link>, and after the Armada, as Gloriana, the eternally youthful <link>Faerie Queene</link> of Edmund Spenser\\'s poem. Elizabeth gave Edmund Spenser a pension; as this was unusual for her, it indicates that she liked his work. Her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic icons that made her look much younger than she was. In fact, her skin had been scarred by smallpox in 1562, leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics. Her love of sweets and fear of dentists contributed to severe tooth decay and loss to such an extent that foreign ambassadors had a hard time understanding her speech. André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from Henry IV of France, reported an audience with the Queen, during which he noticed, \"her teeth are very yellow and unequal ... and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly.\" Yet he added, \"her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal.\" Walter Raleigh called her \"a lady whom time had surprised\".\\n\\nThe more Elizabeth\\'s beauty faded, the more her courtiers praised it. Elizabeth was happy to play the part, but it is possible that in the last decade of her life she began to believe her own performance. She became fond and indulgent of the charming but petulant young Earl of Essex, who was Leicester\\'s stepson and took liberties with her for which she forgave him. She repeatedly appointed him to military posts despite his growing record of irresponsibility. After Essex\\'s desertion of his command in Ireland in 1599, Elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies. In February 1601, Essex tried to raise a rebellion in London. He intended to seize the Queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on 25 February. Elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were partly to blame for this turn of events. An observer wrote in 1602: \"Her delight is to sit in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears to bewail Essex.\"\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s senior adviser, Lord Burghley, died on 4 August 1598. His political mantle passed to his son Robert, who soon became the leader of the government. One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Robert Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret. He therefore entered into a coded negotiation with James VI of Scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim. Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and \"secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions\". The advice worked. James\\'s tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: \"So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort\". In historian <link>J. E. Neale</link>\\'s view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with \"unmistakable if veiled phrases\".\\n\\nThe Queen\\'s health remained fair until the autumn of 1602, when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. In February 1603, the death of <link>Catherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham</link>, the niece of her cousin and close friend Lady Knollys, came as a particular blow. In March, Elizabeth fell sick and remained in a \"settled and unremovable melancholy\", and sat motionless on a cushion for hours on end. When Robert Cecil told her that she must go to bed, she snapped: \"Must is not a word to use to princes, little man.\" She died on 24 March 1603 at <link>Richmond Palace</link>, between two and three in the morning. A few hours later, Cecil and the council set their plans in motion and proclaimed James king of England.\\nWhile it has become normative to record Elizabeth\\'s death as occurring in 1603, following English calendar reform in the 1750s, at the time England observed New Year\\'s Day on 25 March, commonly known as <link>Lady Day</link>. Thus Elizabeth died on the last day of the year 1602 in the old calendar. The modern convention is to use the old style calendar for the day and month while using the new style calendar for the year.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s coffin was carried downriver at night to Whitehall, on a barge lit with torches. At her funeral on 28 April, the coffin was taken to Westminster Abbey on a <link>hearse</link> drawn by four horses hung with black velvet. In the words of the chronicler <link>John Stow</link>:\\n\\nWestminster was surcharged with multitudes of all sorts of people in their streets, houses, windows, leads and gutters, that came out to see the <link>obsequy</link>, and when they beheld her statue lying upon the coffin, there was such a general sighing, groaning and weeping as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man.\\nElizabeth was interred in Westminster Abbey, in a tomb shared with her half-sister, <link>Mary I</link>. The Latin inscription on their tomb, \"Regno consortes & urna, hic obdormimus Elizabetha et Maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis\", translates to \"Consorts in realm and tomb, here we sleep, Elizabeth and Mary, sisters, in hope of resurrection\".\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\nElizabeth was lamented by many of her subjects, but others were relieved at her death. Expectations of King James started high but then declined. By the 1620s, there was a nostalgic revival of the cult of Elizabeth. Elizabeth was praised as a heroine of the Protestant cause and the ruler of a golden age. James was depicted as a Catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court. The triumphalist image that Elizabeth had cultivated towards the end of her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties, was taken at face value and her reputation inflated. <link>Godfrey Goodman</link>, Bishop of Gloucester, recalled: \"When we had experience of a Scottish government, the Queen did seem to revive. Then was her memory much magnified.\" Elizabeth\\'s reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance.\\nThe picture of Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers of the early 17th century has proved lasting and influential. Her memory was also revived during the <link>Napoleonic Wars</link>, when the nation again found itself on the brink of invasion. In the <link>Victorian era</link>, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the imperial ideology of the day, and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and <link>A. L. Rowse</link> (1950), interpreted Elizabeth\\'s reign as a golden age of progress. Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.\\nRecent historians, however, have taken a more complicated view of Elizabeth. Her reign is famous for the defeat of the Armada, and for successful raids against the Spaniards, such as those on Cádiz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. In Ireland, Elizabeth\\'s forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.\\nElizabeth established an English church that helped shape a national identity and remains in place today. Those who praised her later as a Protestant heroine overlooked her refusal to drop all practices of Catholic origin from the Church of England. Historians note that in her day, strict Protestants regarded the Acts of Settlement and Uniformity of 1559 as a compromise. In fact, Elizabeth believed that faith was personal and did not wish, as <link>Francis Bacon</link> put it, to \"make windows into men\\'s hearts and secret thoughts\".\\nThough Elizabeth followed a largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised England\\'s status abroad. \"She is only a woman, only mistress of half an island,\" marvelled <link>Pope Sixtus V</link>, \"and yet she makes herself feared by Spain, by France, by the Empire, by all\".  Under Elizabeth, the nation gained a new self-confidence and sense of sovereignty, as <link>Christendom</link> fragmented. Elizabeth was the first Tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent. She therefore always worked with parliament and advisers she could trust to tell her the truth—a style of government that her Stuart successors failed to follow. Some historians have called her lucky; she believed that God was protecting her. Priding herself on being \"mere English\", Elizabeth trusted in God, honest advice, and the love of her subjects for the success of her rule. In a prayer, she offered thanks to God that:\\n\\n[At a time] when wars and seditions with grievous persecutions have vexed almost all kings and countries round about me, my reign hath been peacable, and my realm a receptacle to thy afflicted Church. The love of my people hath appeared firm, and the devices of my enemies frustrate.\\n\\n\\n== Family tree ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n<link>Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom</link>\\n<link>Early modern Britain</link>\\n<link>English Renaissance</link>\\n<link>Inventory of Elizabeth I</link>\\n<link>Portraiture of Elizabeth I</link>\\n<link>Protestant Reformation</link>\\n<link>Royal Arms of England</link>\\n<link>Royal eponyms in Canada</link> for Queen Elizabeth I\\n<link>Royal Standards of England</link>\\n<link>Tudor period</link>\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== Citations ==\\n\\n\\n=== References ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nElizabeth I at the official website of the <link>British monarchy</link>\\nElizabeth I at the official website of the <link>Royal Collection Trust</link>\\nPortraits of Queen Elizabeth I at the <link>National Portrait Gallery, London</link> \\nWorks by Elizabeth I at <link>Project Gutenberg</link>\\nWorks by or about Elizabeth I at the <link>Internet Archive</link>\\nWorks by Elizabeth I at <link>LibriVox</link> (public domain audiobooks)', 'tool_call_id': 'call_t4YQ3BVLemHVCnrbi5PEs4y8', 'name': 'get_content'}\n",

Its most populous subdivision is Fairfax County, part of <link>Northern Virginia</link>, where slightly over a third of Virginia\\'s population of more than 8.8 million live.\\nEastern Virginia is part of the <link>Atlantic Plain</link>, and the <link>Middle Peninsula</link> forms the mouth of the <link>Chesapeake Bay</link>. Central Virginia lies predominantly in the Piedmont, the foothill region of the <link>Blue Ridge Mountains</link>, which cross the western and southwestern parts of the state. The fertile <link>Shenandoah Valley</link> fosters the state\\'s most productive agricultural counties, while the economy in Northern Virginia is driven by technology companies and U.S. federal government agencies. <link>Hampton Roads</link> is also the site of the region\\'s main seaport and <link>Naval Station Norfolk</link>, the world\\'s largest naval base.\\nVirginia\\'s history begins with several Indigenous groups, including the <link>Powhatan</link>. In 1607, the <link>London Company</link> established the <link>Colony of Virginia</link> as the first permanent English colony in the <link>New World</link>, leading to Virginia\\'s nickname as <link>the Old Dominion</link>. Slaves from Africa and land from displaced native tribes fueled the growing plantation economy, but also fueled conflicts both inside and outside the colony. Virginians fought for the independence of the <link>Thirteen Colonies</link> in the <link>American Revolution</link>, and helped establish the new national government. During the <link>American Civil War</link>, the state government in Richmond joined the Confederacy, while many northwestern counties remained loyal to the Union, which led to the separation of <link>West Virginia</link> in 1863.\\nAlthough the state was under one-party rule for nearly a century following the <link>Reconstruction era</link>, both major political parties have been competitive in Virginia since the repeal of <link>racial segregation</link> laws in the 1960s and 1970s. Virginia\\'s state <link>legislature</link> is the <link>Virginia General Assembly</link>, which was established in July 1619, making it the oldest current law-making body in <link>North America</link>. Unlike other states, cities and counties in Virginia function as equals, but the state government manages most local roads. It is also the only state where governors are prohibited from serving consecutive terms.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Earliest inhabitants ===\\n\\nNomadic hunters are estimated to have arrived in Virginia around 17,000 years ago. Evidence from Daugherty\\'s Cave shows it was regularly used as a <link>rock shelter</link> by 9,800 years ago. During the late <link>Woodland period</link> (500–1000 CE), tribes coalesced, and farming, first of corn and squash, began, with beans and tobacco arriving from the southwest and <link>Mexico</link> by the end of the period. Palisaded towns began to be built around 1200. The native population in the current boundaries of Virginia reached around 50,000 in the 1500s. Large groups in the area at that time included the Algonquian in the Tidewater region, which they referred to as <link>Tsenacommacah</link>, the Iroquoian-speaking Nottoway and <link>Meherrin</link> to the north and south, and the <link>Tutelo</link>, who spoke Siouan, to the west.\\nIn response to threats from these other groups to their trade network, thirty or so Virginia Algonquian-speaking tribes consolidated during the 1570s under Wahunsenacawh, known in English as <link>Chief Powhatan</link>. Powhatan controlled more than 150 settlements that had a total population of around 15,000 in 1607. Three-fourths of the native population in Virginia, however, died from <link>smallpox</link> and other <link>Old World diseases</link> during that century, disrupting their <link>oral tradition</link>s and complicating research into earlier periods. Additionally, many primary sources, including those that mention Powhatan\\'s daughter, <link>Pocahontas</link>, were created by Europeans, who may have held biases or misunderstood native social structures and customs.\\n\\n\\n=== Colony ===\\n\\nSeveral European expeditions, including a group of Spanish Jesuits, explored the Chesapeake Bay during the 16th century. To help counter Spain\\'s colonies in the Caribbean, Queen <link>Elizabeth I of England</link> supported <link>Walter Raleigh</link>\\'s 1584 expedition to the Atlantic coast of North America. The name \"Virginia\" was used by Captain <link>Arthur Barlowe</link> in the expedition\\'s report, and may have been suggested by Raleigh or Elizabeth (perhaps noting her status as the \"Virgin Queen\" or that they viewed the land as being untouched) or related to an Algonquin phrase, Wingandacoa or Windgancon, or leader\\'s name, <link>Wingina</link>, as heard by the expedition. The name initially applied to the entire coastal region from <link>South Carolina</link> in the south to <link>Maine</link> in the north, along with the island of <link>Bermuda</link>. Raleigh\\'s colony failed, but the potential financial and strategic gains still captivated many English policymakers. In 1606, King James I issued a charter for a new colony to the Virginia Company of London. The group financed an expedition under <link>Christopher Newport</link> that established a settlement named Jamestown in 1607.\\nThough more settlers soon joined, many were ill-prepared for the dangers of the new settlement. As the colony\\'s president, John Smith secured food for the colonists from nearby tribes, but after he left in 1609, this trade stopped and a series of ambush-style killings between colonists and natives under Chief Powhatan and his brother began, resulting in mass starvation in the colony that winter. By the end of the colony\\'s first fourteen years, over eighty percent of the roughly eight thousand settlers transported there had died. Demand for exported tobacco, however, fueled the need for more workers. Starting in 1618, the <link>headright</link> system tried to solve this by granting colonists farmland for their help attracting <link>indentured servant</link>s. Enslaved Africans were first sold in Virginia in 1619. Though other Africans arrived as indentured servants and could be freed after four to seven years, the basis for lifelong slavery was developed in legal cases like those of John Punch in 1640 and <link>John Casor</link> in 1655. Laws passed in Jamestown defined slavery as race-based in 1661, as inherited maternally in 1662, and as enforceable by death in 1669.\\n\\nFrom the colony\\'s start, residents agitated for greater local control, and in 1619, certain male colonists began electing representatives to an assembly, later called the <link>House of Burgesses</link>, that negotiated issues with the governing council appointed by the London Company. Unhappy with this arrangement, the monarchy revoked the company\\'s charter and began directly naming governors and Council members in 1624. In 1635, colonists arrested a governor who ignored the assembly and sent him back to England against his will. William Berkeley was named governor in 1642, just as the turmoil of the <link>English Civil War</link> and Interregnum permitted the colony greater autonomy. As a supporter of the king, Berkeley welcomed other <link>Cavalier</link>s who fled to Virginia. He surrendered to Parliamentarians in 1652, but after the 1660 Restoration made him governor again, he blocked assembly elections and exacerbated the class divide by disenfranchising and restricting the movement of indentured servants, who made up around eighty percent of the workforce. On the colony\\'s frontier, tribes like the Tutelo and Doeg were being squeezed by Seneca raiders from the north, leading to more confrontations with colonists. In 1676, several hundred working-class followers of Nathaniel Bacon, upset by Berkeley\\'s refusal to retaliate against the tribes, burned Jamestown.\\n<link>Bacon\\'s Rebellion</link> forced the signing of <link>Bacon\\'s Laws</link>, which restored some of the colony\\'s rights and sanctioned both attacks on native tribes and the enslavement of their people. The <link>Treaty of 1677</link> further reduced the independence of the tribes that signed it, and aided the colony\\'s assimilation of their land in the years that followed. Colonists in the 1700s were pushing westward into the area held by the Seneca and their larger <link>Iroquois</link> Nation, and in 1748, a group of wealthy speculators, backed by the British monarchy, formed the <link>Ohio Company</link> to start English settlement and trade in the <link>Ohio Country</link> west of the Appalachian Mountains. <link>France</link>, which claimed this area as part of <link>New France</link>, viewed this as a threat, and in 1754 the <link>French and Indian War</link> engulfed England, France, the Iroquois, and other allied tribes on both sides. A militia from several British colonies, called the <link>Virginia Regiment</link>, was led by Major <link>George Washington</link>, himself one of the investors in the <link>Ohio</link> Company.\\n\\n\\n=== Statehood ===\\n\\nIn the decade following the French and Indian War, the British Parliament passed new taxes which were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to taxation without representation was led by <link>Patrick Henry</link> and <link>Richard Henry Lee</link>, among others. Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773 and sent delegates to the <link>Continental Congress</link> the following year. After the House of Burgesses was dissolved in 1774 by the royal governor, Virginia\\'s revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the <link>Virginia Conventions</link>. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia\\'s independence and adopted <link>George Mason</link>\\'s <link>Virginia Declaration of Rights</link>, which was then included in a new constitution that designated Virginia as a commonwealth. Another Virginian, <link>Thomas Jefferson</link>, drew upon Mason\\'s work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.\\nAfter the <link>American Revolutionary War</link> began, George Washington was selected by the <link>Second Continental Congress</link> in <link>Philadelphia</link> to head the <link>Continental Army</link>, and many Virginians joined the army and revolutionary militias. Virginia was the first colony to ratify the <link>Articles of Confederation</link> in December 1777. In April 1780, the capital was moved to Richmond at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg\\'s coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack. British forces under <link>Benedict Arnold</link> did take Portsmouth in December 1780, and raided Richmond the following month. The British army had over seven thousand soldiers and twenty-five warships stationed in Virginia at the beginning of 1781, but General Charles Cornwallis and his superiors were indecisive, and maneuvers by the three thousand soldiers under the Marquis de Lafayette and twenty-nine allied French warships together managed to confine the British to a swampy area of the <link>Virginia Peninsula</link> in September. Around sixteen thousand soldiers under George Washington and <link>Comte de Rochambeau</link> quickly converged there and defeated Cornwallis in the <link>siege of Yorktown</link>. His surrender on October 19, 1781, led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies.\\nVirginians were instrumental in writing the <link>United States Constitution</link>: <link>James Madison</link> drafted the <link>Virginia Plan</link> in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1789. Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25, 1788. The <link>three-fifths compromise</link> ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the House of Representatives. Together with the <link>Virginia dynasty</link> of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. Virginia is called the \"Mother of States\" because of its role in being carved into states such as <link>Kentucky</link>, and for the numbers of <link>American pioneer</link>s born in Virginia.\\n\\n\\n=== Civil War ===\\n\\nBetween 1790 and 1860, the number of slaves in Virginia rose from around 290 thousand to over 490 thousand, roughly one-third of the state population, and the number of slave owners rose to over 50 thousand. Both of these numbers represented the most in the U.S. The boom in Southern cotton production using <link>cotton gin</link>s to harvest upland cotton increased the amount of labor needed, but new federal laws prohibited the importation of slaves. Decades of <link>monoculture</link> tobacco farming had also degraded Virginia\\'s <link>agricultural productivity</link>. Virginia plantations increasingly turned to exporting slaves, which broke up countless families and made the breeding of slaves, often through rape, a profitable business. Slaves in the Richmond area were also forced into industrial jobs, including mining and shipbuilding. The failed slave uprisings of <link>Gabriel Prosser</link> in 1800, <link>George Boxley</link> in 1815, and <link>Nat Turner</link> in 1831, however, marked the growing resistance to slavery. Afraid of further uprisings, Virginia\\'s government in the 1830s encouraged free Blacks to migrate to <link>Liberia</link>.\\nOn October 16, 1859, abolitionist John Brown led a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in an attempt to start a slave revolt across the southern states. The polarized national response to his raid, capture, trial, and execution that December marked a tipping point for many who believed slavery would need to be ended by force. <link>Abraham Lincoln</link>\\'s 1860 election further convinced many southern supporters of slavery that his opposition to its expansion would ultimately mean the end of slavery across the country. The seizure of Fort Sumter by Confederate forces on April 14, 1861, prompted Lincoln to call for the federalization of 75,000 militiamen.\\n\\nThe <link>Virginia Secession Convention of 1861</link> voted on April 17 to secede on the condition it was approved in a referendum the next month. The convention voted to join the Confederacy, which named Richmond its capital on May 20. During the May 23 referendum, armed pro-Confederate groups prevented the casting and counting of votes from areas that opposed secession. Representatives from 27 of these northwestern counties instead began the <link>Wheeling Convention</link>, which organized a government loyal to the Union and led to the separation of West Virginia as a new state.\\nThe armies of the Union and Confederacy first met on July 21, 1861, in Battle of Bull Run near <link>Manassas, Virginia</link>, a bloody Confederate victory. Union General <link>George B. McClellan</link> organized the <link>Army of the Potomac</link>, which landed on the Virginia Peninsula in March 1862 and reached the outskirts of Richmond that June. With Confederate General <link>Joseph E. Johnston</link> wounded in fighting outside the city, command of his <link>Army of Northern Virginia</link> fell to <link>Robert E. Lee</link>. Over the next month, Lee drove the Union army back, and starting that September led the first of several invasions into Union <link>territory</link>. During the next three years of war, more battles were fought in Virginia than anywhere else, including the battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Spotsylvania, and the concluding <link>Battle of Appomattox Court House</link>, where Lee surrendered on April 9, 1865.\\n\\n\\n=== Reconstruction and segregation ===\\n\\nVirginia was formally restored to the United States in 1870, due to the work of the <link>Committee of Nine</link>. During the post-war Reconstruction era, African Americans were able to unite in communities, particularly around Richmond, Danville, and the Tidewater region, and take a greater role in Virginia society; many achieved some land ownership during the 1870s. Virginia adopted a constitution in 1868 which guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights, and provided for free public schools. However, with many railroad lines and other infrastructure destroyed during the Civil War, the Commonwealth was deeply in debt, and in the late 1870s redirected money from public schools to pay bondholders. The <link>Readjuster Party</link> formed in 1877 and won legislative power in 1879 by uniting Black and white Virginians behind a shared opposition to debt payments and the perceived plantation elites.\\nThe Readjusters focused on building up schools, like <link>Virginia Tech</link> and Virginia State, and successfully forced West Virginia to share in the pre-war debt. But in 1883, they were divided by a proposed repeal of <link>anti-miscegenation laws</link>, and days before that year\\'s election, a riot in Danville, involving armed policemen, left four Black men and one white man dead. These events motivated a push by white supremacists to seize political power through voter suppression, and segregationists in the Democratic Party won the legislature that year and maintained control for decades. They passed <link>Jim Crow laws</link> that established a racially segregated society, and in 1902 rewrote the state constitution to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites.\\nNew economic forces meanwhile industrialized the Commonwealth. Virginian <link>James Albert Bonsack</link> invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new large-scale production centered around Richmond. Railroad magnate <link>Collis Potter Huntington</link> founded <link>Newport News Shipbuilding</link> in 1886, which was responsible for building 38 warships for the <link>U.S. Navy</link> between 1907 and 1923. During <link>World War I</link>, German submarines attacked ships outside the port, which was a major site for transportation of soldiers and supplies. After the war, a homecoming parade to honor African-American troops was attacked in July 1919 by the city\\'s police as part of a renewed white-supremacy movement, known as <link>Red Summer</link>. The shipyard continued building warships in <link>World War II</link>, and quadrupled its pre-war labor force to 70,000 by 1943. The Radford Arsenal outside Blacksburg also employed 22,000 workers making explosives, while the Torpedo Factory in Alexandria had over 5,050.\\n\\n\\n=== Civil rights to present ===\\n\\nHigh-school student <link>Barbara Rose Johns</link> started a strike in 1951 at her underfunded and segregated school in Prince Edward County. The protests led Spottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill to file a lawsuit against the county. Their case joined <link>Brown v. Board of Education</link> at the Supreme Court, which rejected the doctrine of \"<link>separate but equal</link>\" in 1954. The segregationist establishment, led by Senator <link>Harry F. Byrd</link> and his <link>Byrd Organization</link>, reacted with a strategy called \"<link>massive resistance</link>\", and the General Assembly passed a package of laws in 1956 that cut off funding to local schools that desegregated, causing some to close. Courts ruled the strategy unconstitutional, and on February 2, 1959, Black students integrated schools in Arlington and Norfolk, where they were known as the <link>Norfolk 17</link>. Rather than integrate, county leaders in Prince Edward shut their school system in June 1959. When litigation again reached the Supreme Court, it ordered the county to reopen and integrate its schools, which finally happened in September 1964.\\nFederal passage of the Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965), and their later enforcement by the Justice Department, helped end racial segregation in Virginia and overturn Jim Crow laws. In 1967, the Supreme Court struck down the state\\'s ban on interracial marriage with <link>Loving v. Virginia</link>. In 1968, Governor <link>Mills Godwin</link> called a commission to rewrite the state constitution. The new constitution, which banned discrimination and removed articles that now violated federal law, passed in a referendum and went into effect in 1971. In 1989, <link>Douglas Wilder</link> became the first African American elected as governor in the United States, and in 1992, Bobby Scott became the first Black congressman from Virginia since 1888.\\nThe expansion of federal government offices into Northern Virginia\\'s suburbs during the <link>Cold War</link> boosted the region\\'s population and economy. The <link>Central Intelligence Agency</link> outgrew their offices in <link>Foggy Bottom</link> during the <link>Korean War</link>, and moved to Langley in 1961, in part due to a decision by the National Security Council that the agency relocate outside the District of Columbia. <link>The Pentagon</link>, built in Arlington during World War II as the headquarters of the Department of Defense, was struck by a hijacked plane in the <link>September 11, 2001 attacks</link>. Mass shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 and in Virginia Beach in 2019 led to passage of gun control measures in 2020. Racial injustice and the presence of Confederate monuments in Virginia have also led to large demonstrations, including in August 2017, when a white supremacist drove his car into protesters, killing one, and in June 2020, when protests that were part of the larger <link>Black Lives Matter</link> movement brought about the removal of Confederate statues.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\nVirginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States. Virginia has a total area of 42,774.2 square miles (110,784.7 km2), including 3,180.13 square miles (8,236.5 km2) of water, making it the 35th-largest state by area. It is bordered by <link>Maryland</link> and <link>Washington, D.C.</link> to the northeast; by the <link>Atlantic Ocean</link> to the east; by <link>North Carolina</link> to the south; by <link>Tennessee</link> to the southwest; by Kentucky to the west; and by West Virginia to the northwest. Virginia\\'s boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C., the low-water mark of the south shore of the <link>Potomac River</link>, has been an issue for <link>water right</link>s.\\nVirginia\\'s southern border was defined in 1665 as 36°30\\' north latitude. Surveyors marking the border with North Carolina in the 18th century however started about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) to the north and drifted an additional 3.5 miles by the border\\'s westernmost point. After Tennessee joined the U.S. in 1796, new surveyors worked in 1802 and 1803 to reset their border with Virginia as a line from the summit of <link>White Top Mountain</link> to the top of <link>Tri-State Peak</link> in the <link>Cumberland Mountains</link>. However, deviations in that border were identified when it was re-marked in 1856, and the Virginia General Assembly proposed a new surveying commission in 1871. Representatives from Tennessee preferred to keep the less-straight 1803 line, and in 1893, the <link>U.S. Supreme Court</link> ruled for them against Virginia. One result is how the city of Bristol is divided in two between the states.\\n\\n\\n=== Geology and terrain ===\\n\\nThe Chesapeake Bay separates the contiguous portion of the Commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of Virginia\\'s Eastern Shore. The bay was formed from the drowned river valley of the ancient <link>Susquehanna River</link>. Many of Virginia\\'s rivers flow into the Chesapeake Bay, including the Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James, which create three peninsulas in the bay, traditionally referred to as \"necks\" named <link>Northern Neck</link>, Middle Peninsula, and the Virginia Peninsula from north to south. <link>Sea level rise</link> has eroded the land on Virginia\\'s islands, which include Tangier Island in the bay and Chincoteague, one of 23 barrier islands on the Atlantic coast.\\nThe Tidewater is a coastal plain between the Atlantic coast and the fall line. It includes the Eastern Shore and major estuaries of Chesapeake Bay. The Piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock-based <link>foothills</link> east of the mountains. The region, known for its heavy clay soil, includes the <link>Southwest Mountains</link> around Charlottesville. The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the Appalachian Mountains with the highest points in the Commonwealth, the tallest being Mount Rogers at 5,729 feet (1,746 m). The Ridge-and-Valley region is west of the mountains, <link>carbonate rock</link> based, and includes the <link>Massanutten Mountain</link> ridge and the <link>Great Appalachian Valley</link>, which is called the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, named after the river of the same name that flows through it. The <link>Cumberland Plateau</link> and Cumberland Mountains are in the southwest corner of Virginia, south of the <link>Allegheny Plateau</link>. In this region, rivers flow northwest into the <link>Ohio River</link> basin.\\nVirginia\\'s seismic zones have not had a history of regular <link>earthquake</link> activity. Earthquakes are rarely above 4.5 in magnitude. The Commonwealth\\'s largest earthquake in at least a century, at a magnitude of 5.8, struck central Virginia on August 23, 2011. 35 million years ago, a <link>bolide</link> impacted what is now eastern Virginia. The resulting <link>Chesapeake Bay impact crater</link> may explain what earthquakes and <link>subsidence</link> the region does experience. A meteor impact is also theorized as the source of <link>Lake Drummond</link>, the largest of the two natural lakes in the state.\\nThe Commonwealth\\'s carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 <link>limestone cave</link>s, ten of which are open for tourism, including the popular <link>Luray Caverns</link> and <link>Skyline Caverns</link>. Virginia\\'s iconic Natural Bridge is the remaining roof of a collapsed limestone cave. Coal mining takes place in the three mountainous regions. More than 72 million tons of other non-fuel resources, such as <link>slate</link>, <link>kyanite</link>, sand, or gravel, were mined in Virginia in 2020. The largest known deposits of <link>uranium</link> in the U.S. are under Coles Hill, Virginia. Despite a challenge that reached the U.S. Supreme Court twice, the state has banned its mining since 1982 due to environmental and public health concerns.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nVirginia has a <link>humid subtropical climate</link> that transitions to humid continental west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Seasonal extremes vary from average lows of 25 °F (−4 °C) in January to average highs of 86 °F (30 °C) in July. The Atlantic Ocean and <link>Gulf Stream</link> have a strong effect on eastern and southeastern coastal areas, making the climate there warmer but also more constant. Most of Virginia\\'s recorded extremes in temperature and precipitation have occurred in the Blue Ridge Mountains and areas west. Virginia receives an average of 43.47 inches (110 cm) of precipitation annually, with the Shenandoah Valley being the state\\'s driest region.\\nVirginia has around 35–45 days with thunderstorms annually, and storms are common in the late afternoon and evenings between April and September. These months are also the most common for tornadoes, twelve of which touched down in the Commonwealth in 2024. Hurricanes and tropical storms can occur from August to October. The deadliest natural disaster in Virginia was <link>Hurricane Camille</link>, which killed over 150 people in 1969 mainly in inland Nelson County. Between December and March, <link>cold-air damming</link> caused by the Appalachian Mountains can lead to significant snowfalls across the state, such as the January 2016 blizzard, which created the state\\'s highest recorded one-day snowfall of 36.6 inches (93 cm) near Bluemont. On average, cities in Virginia can receive between 5.8–12.3 inches (15–31 cm) of snow annually, but recent winters have seen below-average snowfalls, and much of Virginia had no measurable snow during the 2022–2023 winter season.\\n<link>Climate change in Virginia</link> is leading to higher temperatures year-round as well as more heavy rain and flooding events. <link>Urban heat island</link>s can be found in many Virginia cities and suburbs, particularly in neighborhoods linked to historic <link>redlining</link>. The air in Virginia has statistically improved since 1998. The closure and conversion of <link>coal power plant</link>s in Virginia and the Ohio Valley region has helped cut the amount of particulate matter in Virginia\\'s air in half. Current plans call for 30% of the Commonwealth\\'s electricity to be renewable by 2030 and for all to be carbon-free by 2050.\\n\\n\\n=== Ecosystem ===\\n\\nForests cover 62% of Virginia as of 2021, of which 80% is considered <link>hardwood</link> forest, meaning that trees are primarily <link>deciduous</link> and broad-leaved. The other 20% is pine, with loblolly and shortleaf pine dominating much of central and eastern Virginia. In the western and mountainous parts of the Commonwealth, <link>oak</link> and hickory are most common, while lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of hemlocks and mosses in abundance. Spongy moth infestations in oak trees and the blight in chestnut trees have decreased both of their numbers, leaving more room for hickory and the invasive tree of heaven. In the lowland tidewater and Piedmont, yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps. Other common trees include red spruce, Atlantic white cedar, tulip-poplar, and the flowering dogwood, the state tree and flower. Plants like milkweed, dandelions, daisies, ferns, and Virginia creeper, which is featured on the state flag, are also common. The Thompson Wildlife Area in Fauquier is known for having one of the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America.\\n<link>White-tailed deer</link>, one of 75 mammal species found in Virginia, rebounded from an estimated population of as few as 25,000 in the 1930s to over one million by the 2010s. Native carnivorans include black bears, who have a population of around five to six thousand in the state, as well as <link>bobcat</link>s, <link>coyote</link>s, both gray and red foxes, <link>raccoon</link>s, <link>weasel</link>s and <link>skunk</link>s. Rodents include <link>groundhog</link>s, <link>nutria</link>, <link>beaver</link>s, both gray squirrels and <link>fox squirrel</link>s, chipmunks, and <link>Allegheny woodrat</link>s, while the seventeen bat species include brown bats and the <link>Virginia big-eared bat</link>, the state mammal. The <link>Virginia opossum</link> is the only <link>marsupial</link> native to the United States and <link>Canada</link>, and the native <link>Appalachian cottontail</link> was recognized in 1992 as a distinct species of rabbit, one of three found in the state. Whales, dolphins, and porpoises have been recorded in Virginia\\'s coastal waters, with <link>bottlenose dolphins</link> being the most frequent <link>aquatic mammal</link>s.\\n\\nVirginia\\'s bird fauna comprises 422 counted species, of which 359 are regularly occurring and 214 have bred in Virginia, while the rest are mostly winter residents or transients. <link>Water birds</link> include sandpipers, wood ducks, and <link>Virginia rail</link>, while common inland examples include warblers, woodpeckers, and cardinals, the state bird. Birds of prey include <link>osprey</link>, <link>broad-winged hawk</link>s, and <link>barred owl</link>s. There are no endemic bird species. Audubon recognizes 21 <link>Important Bird Area</link>s in the state. <link>Peregrine falcon</link>s, whose numbers dramatically declined due to <link>DDT</link> poisoning in the middle of the 20th century, are the focus of conservation efforts in the state and a reintroduction program in <link>Shenandoah National Park</link>.\\nVirginia has 226 species of <link>freshwater fish</link> from 25 families, a diversity attributable to the area\\'s varied and humid climate, topography, interconnected river system, and lack of Pleistocene glaciers. Common examples on the Cumberland Plateau and higher-elevation regions include <link>Eastern blacknose dace</link>, <link>sculpin</link>, <link>smallmouth bass</link>, <link>redhorse sucker</link>, <link>Kanawha darter</link>, and <link>brook trout</link>, the state fish. Downhill in the Piedmont, <link>stripeback darter</link> and <link>Roanoke bass</link> become common, as do <link>swampfish</link>, <link>bluespotted sunfish</link>, and <link>pirate perch</link> in the Tidewater. The Chesapeake Bay hosts clams, oysters, and 350 species of saltwater and estuarine fish, including the bay\\'s most abundant finfish, the <link>Bay anchovy</link>, as well as the invasive <link>blue catfish</link>. An estimated 238 million Chesapeake blue crabs live in the bay as of 2025. There are 34 native species of crayfish, like the Big Sandy. Amphibians found in Virginia include the <link>Cumberland Plateau salamander</link> and <link>Eastern hellbender</link>, while the <link>northern watersnake</link> is the most common of the 32 snake species.\\n\\n\\n=== Protected lands ===\\n\\nAs of 2019, roughly 16.2% of land in the Commonwealth is protected by federal, state, and local governments and non-profits. Federal lands account for the majority, with thirty <link>National Park Service</link> units, such as <link>Great Falls Park</link> and the <link>Appalachian Trail</link>, and one national park, Shenandoah. Almost forty percent of Shenandoah\\'s total 199,173 acres (806 km2) area has been designated as wilderness under the <link>National Wilderness Preservation System</link>. The U.S. Forest Service administers the <link>George Washington and Jefferson National Forests</link>, which cover more than 1.6 million acres (6,500 km2) within Virginia\\'s mountains, and continue into West Virginia and Kentucky. The <link>Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge</link> also extends into North Carolina, as does the <link>Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge</link>, which marks the beginning of the <link>Outer Banks</link>.\\nState agencies control about one-third of protected land in the state, and the <link>Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation</link> manages over 75,900 acres (307.2 km2) in forty Virginia state parks and 59,222 acres (239.7 km2) in 65 Natural Area Preserves, plus three undeveloped parks. <link>Breaks Interstate Park</link> crosses the Kentucky border and is one of only two inter-state parks in the United States. Sustainable logging is allowed in 26 state forests managed by the <link>Virginia Department of Forestry</link> totaling 71,972 acres (291.3 km2), as is hunting in 44 Wildlife Management Areas run by the <link>Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources</link> covering over 205,000 acres (829.6 km2). The Chesapeake Bay is not a national park, but is protected by both state and federal legislation and the inter-state <link>Chesapeake Bay Program</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== Cities and towns ===\\n\\nVirginia is divided into 95 counties and 38 independent cities, which the <link>U.S. Census Bureau</link> describes as <link>county-equivalent</link>s. This general method of treating cities and counties on par with each other is unique to Virginia and stretches back to the influence of Williamsburg and Norfolk in the colonial period. Only three other independent cities exist elsewhere in the US. The differences between counties and cities in Virginia are small and have to do with how each assess new taxes, whether a referendum is necessary to issue bonds, and with the application of <link>Dillon\\'s Rule</link>, which limits the authority of cities and counties to countermand acts expressly allowed by the General Assembly. Counties can also have incorporated towns, and while there are no further administrative subdivisions, the Census Bureau recognizes several hundred unincorporated communities.\\n\\nOver three million people, 35% of Virginians, live in the twenty jurisdictions collectively defined as Northern Virginia, part of the larger <link>Washington metropolitan area</link> and the <link>Northeast megalopolis</link>. Fairfax County, with more than 1.1 million residents, is Virginia\\'s most populous jurisdiction, and has a major urban business and shopping center in <link>Tysons, Virginia</link>\\'s largest office market. Neighboring Prince William County, with over 450,000 residents, is Virginia\\'s second-most populous county and home to <link>Marine Corps Base Quantico</link>, the <link>FBI Academy</link>, and <link>Manassas National Battlefield Park</link>. Arlington County is the smallest self-governing county in the U.S. by land area, and local politicians have proposed reorganizing it as an independent city due to its high density. Loudoun County is the fastest-growing county in the state. In <link>western Virginia</link>, Roanoke city and Montgomery County, part of the <link>Blacksburg–Christiansburg metropolitan area</link>, both have surpassed a population of 100,000 since 2018.\\nOn the western edge of the Tidewater region is Virginia\\'s capital, Richmond, which has a population of around 230,000 in its city proper and over 1.3 million in its metropolitan area. On the eastern edge is the Hampton Roads metropolitan area, where over 1.7 million reside across six counties and nine cities, including the Commonwealth\\'s three most populous independent cities: Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, and Norfolk. Neighboring Suffolk, which includes a portion of the <link>Great Dismal Swamp</link>, is the largest city by area at 429.1 square miles (1,111 km2). One reason for the concentration of independent cities in the Tidewater region is that several rural counties there re-incorporated as cities or consolidated with existing cities to try to hold on to their new suburban neighborhoods that started booming in the 1950s, since cities like Norfolk and Portsmouth were able to annex land from adjoining counties until a moratorium in 1987. Others, like Poquoson, became cities to try to preserve racial segregation during the desegregation era of the 1970s.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nThe 2020 census found the state resident population was 8,631,393, a 7.9% increase since the 2010 census. Another 23,149 Virginians live overseas, giving the state a total population of 8,654,542. Virginia has the fourth-largest overseas population of <link>U.S. state</link>s due to its federal employees and military personnel. The <link>fertility rate</link> in Virginia as of 2020 was 55.8 per 1,000 females between the ages of 15 and 44, and the median age as of 2021 was the same as the national average of 38.8 years old. The geographic <link>center of population</link> is located northwest of Richmond in Hanover County, as of 2020.\\nThough still growing naturally as births outnumber deaths, Virginia has had a negative <link>net migration rate</link> since 2013, with 8,995 more people leaving the state than moving to it in 2021. This is largely credited to high home prices in Northern Virginia, which are driving residents there to relocate south; Raleigh is their top destination. Aside from Virginia, the top birth state for Virginians is New York, with the Northeast accounting for the largest number of domestic migrants into the state by region. About twelve percent of residents were born outside the United States as of 2020. <link>El Salvador</link> is the most common foreign country of birth, with <link>India</link>, Mexico, <link>South Korea</link>, the <link>Philippines</link>, and <link>Vietnam</link> as other common birthplaces.\\n\\n\\n=== Race and ethnicity ===\\nThe state\\'s most populous racial group, <link>non-Hispanic whites</link>, has declined as a proportion of the population from 76% in 1990 to 58.6% in 2020. Immigrants from Britain and Ireland settled throughout the Commonwealth during the colonial period, when roughly three-fourths of immigrants came as indentured servants. The Appalachian mountains and Shenandoah Valley have many settlements that were populated by German and Scotch-Irish immigrants in the 18th and 19th centuries, often following the <link>Great Wagon Road</link>. Over ten percent of Virginians have German ancestry as of 2020.\\n\\nThe largest minority group in Virginia are Blacks and African Americans, about one-fifth of the population. Virginia was a major destination of the <link>Atlantic slave trade</link>. The Igbo ethnic group of what is now southern <link>Nigeria</link> were the largest African group among slaves in Virginia. Blacks in Virginia also have more European ancestry than those in other southern states, and DNA analysis shows many have asymmetrical male and female ancestry from before the Civil War, evidence of European fathers and African or Native American mothers. Though the Black population was reduced by the Great Migration to northern industrial cities in the first half of the 20th century, since 1965 there has been a reverse migration of Blacks returning south. The Commonwealth has the highest number of Black-white interracial marriages in the US, and 8.2% of Virginians describe themselves as multiracial.\\nMore recent immigration since the late 20th century has resulted in new communities of Hispanics and Asians. As of 2020, 10.5% of Virginia\\'s total population describe themselves as Hispanic or Latino, and 8.8% as Asian. The state\\'s Hispanic population rose by 92% from 2000 to 2010, with two-thirds of Hispanics in the state living in Northern Virginia. Northern Virginia also has a significant population of <link>Vietnamese American</link>s, whose major wave of immigration followed the <link>Vietnam War</link>. <link>Korean American</link>s have migrated there more recently, while about 45,000 <link>Filipino American</link>s have settled in the Hampton Roads area.\\n\\nTribal membership in Virginia is complicated by the legacy of the state\\'s \"pencil genocide\" of intentionally categorizing Native Americans and Blacks together, and many tribal members do have African or European ancestry, or both. In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau found that only 0.5% of Virginians were exclusively American Indian or <link>Alaska Native</link>, though 2.1% were in some combination with other ethnicities. The state government has extended recognition to eleven tribes. Seven tribes also have federal recognition. The <link>Pamunkey</link> and <link>Mattaponi</link> have reservations on tributaries of the York River in the Tidewater region.\\n\\n\\n=== Languages ===\\n\\nAccording to U.S. Census data as of 2022 on Virginia residents aged five and older, 83% (6,805,548) speak English at home as a <link>first language</link>. Spanish is the next most commonly spoken language, with 7.5% (611,831) of Virginia households, though age is a factor; 8.7% (120,560) of Virginians under age eighteen speak Spanish. Arabic was the third most commonly spoken language with around 0.8% of residents, followed by <link>Chinese language</link>s  and Vietnamese each with over 0.7%, and then Korean and Tagalog, just under 0.7% and 0.6% respectively.\\nEnglish was passed as the Commonwealth\\'s official language by statutes in 1981 and again in 1996, though the status is not mandated by the constitution. While a more homogenized <link>American English</link> is found in urban areas, and the use of Southern accents in general has been on the decline in speakers born since the 1960s, various accents are still present. The Piedmont region is known for its non-rhotic dialect\\'s strong influence on <link>Southern American English</link>, and a <link>BBC America</link> study in 2014 ranked it as one of the most identifiable accents in American English. The <link>Tidewater accent</link> evolved from the language that upper-class English typically spoke in the early Colonial period, while the Appalachian accent has much more influence from the English spoken by Scottish and Irish immigrants from that time. The outward stereotypes of Appalachians has, however, led to some from the region <link>code-switching</link> to a less distinct English accent. The English spoken on Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay, preserved by the island\\'s isolation, contains many phrases and euphemisms not found anywhere else and retains elements of <link>Early Modern English</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nVirginia enshrined religious freedom in a 1786 statute. Though the state is historically part of America\\'s <link>Bible Belt</link>, the 2023 <link>Public Religion Research Institute</link> (PRRI) survey estimated that 55% of Virginians either seldom or never attend religious services, ahead of the national average of 53.2%, and that the percent of Virginians unaffiliated with any particular religious body had increased from 21% in 2013 to 29% in 2023. The 2020 U.S. Religion Census conducted by the <link>Association of Religion Data Archives</link> (ARDA) similarly found that 55% of Virginians attend none of the state\\'s 10,477 congregations. Overall <link>belief in God</link> has also declined in the South region, of which Virginia is a part, from 93% of respondents in Gallup surveys from 2013 to 2017, to 86% in 2022.\\nOf the 45% of Virginians who were associated with religious bodies in the 2020 ARDA census, Evangelical Protestants made up the largest overall grouping, with 20.3% of the state\\'s population, while 8.1% and 2% were mainline and Black Protestant respectively. <link>Baptists</link>, 84% of which are counted as Evangelical, included 9.4% of Virginians in that census. Their major division is between the <link>Baptist General Association of Virginia</link>, which formed in 1823, and the <link>Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia</link>, which split off in 1996. Other Protestant branches with over one percent of Virginians included <link>Pentecostalism</link> (1.8%), <link>Presbyterianism</link> (1.3%), <link>Anglicanism</link> (1.2%), and <link>Adventism</link> (1%). The 2023 PRRI survey estimated that 46% of Virginians were Protestants, with 14% each as White Evangelical, White Mainline, and Black, though these numbers include individuals who report not attending services.\\n\\nCatholics accounted for 10.3% in the 2020 ARDA census, and 16% in the 2023 PRRI survey, which divided them into 9% White Catholic, 6% Hispanic Catholic, and 1% other. Catholic churches are organized in either the Diocese of Arlington or Richmond, while Episcopal churches are similarly in their Diocese of Virginia, Southern Virginia, and Southwestern Virginia. Adherents of <link>the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</link> constitute just over one percent of the population, with 210 congregations in Virginia as of 2024. While the state\\'s Jewish population is small, organized Jewish sites date to 1789 with <link>Congregation Beth Ahabah</link>.\\nFairfax County is the state\\'s most religiously diverse jurisdiction. Fairfax Station is the site of the <link>Ekoji Buddhist Temple</link>, of the <link>Jōdo Shinshū</link> school, and the Hindu <link>Durga Temple of Virginia</link>. The <link>All Dulles Area <link>Muslim</link> Society</link>, on the county\\'s border in Sterling, considers its eleven branches the country\\'s second-largest Muslim mosque community. <link>McLean Bible Church</link>, with around 16,500 weekly visitors, is among the top 25 largest megachurches in the U.S. and 8.4% of Virginians attend nondenomination Christian churches like it, according to the 2020 ARDA census. Lynchburg and Roanoke ranked in that census as the two metropolitan areas with the highest rates of religious adherence, while the state-college-dominated Blacksburg–Christiansburg and Charlottesville were the lowest. Two major Christian universities, <link>Liberty University</link> and the <link>University of Lynchburg</link>, are based in Lynchburg, while <link>Regent University</link> is in Virginia Beach.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\nVirginia\\'s economy has diverse sources of income, including local and federal government, military, farming and high-tech. The state\\'s average per capita income in 2022 was $68,211, and the gross domestic product (GDP) was $654.5 billion, both ranking as 13th-highest among U.S. states. The <link>COVID-19 recession</link> caused jobless claims due to soar over 10% in early April 2020, returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. In March 2025, the unemployment rate was 3.2%, which was the 11h-lowest nationwide.\\nVirginia has a <link>median household income</link> of $96,490, as of 2023, 8th-highest nationwide, and a poverty rate of 10.3%, 10th-lowest nationwide. Montgomery County outside Blacksburg has the highest poverty rate in the state, with 28.5% falling below the U.S. Census poverty thresholds. Loudoun County meanwhile has the highest median household income in the nation, and the wider Northern Virginia region is among the highest-income regions nationwide. As of 2022, eighteen of the hundred <link>highest-income counties in the United States</link>, including the two highest, are located in Northern Virginia. Though median home prices in Virginia are generally above the national average, particularly in Northern Virginia, where they were 44.8% higher in May 2024, at $760,000, 69.1% of Virginians own their home as of 2023. The Hampton Roads region has the state\\'s highest per capita number of homeless individuals, with 11 per 10,000, as of 2020. Though the Gini index shows Virginia has less <link>income inequality</link> than the national average, the state\\'s middle class is also smaller than the majority of states.\\n<link>CNBC</link> ranked Virginia as their 2024 Top State for Business, with its deductions being mainly for the high cost of business and living, while <link>Forbes</link> magazine ranked it as the sixteenth best to start a business in. <link>Oxfam America</link> however ranked Virginia in 2024 as only the 26th-best state to work in, with pluses for worker protections from sexual harassment and <link>pregnancy discrimination</link>, but negatives for laws on organized labor and the low tipped employee <link>minimum wage</link> of $2.13. Virginia has been an employment-at-will state since 1906 and a \"right to work\" state since 1947, and though state minimum wage increased to $12 in 2023, farm and tipped workers are specifically excluded.\\n\\n\\n=== Government agencies ===\\n\\nGovernment agencies directly employ around 714,100 Virginians as of 2022, almost 17% of all employees in the state. Approximately 12% of all U.S. federal procurement money is spent in Virginia, the second-highest amount after <link>California</link>. As of 2020, 125,648 active-duty personnel, 25,404 reservists, and 99,832 civilians work directly for the <link>U.S. Department of Defense</link> at the Pentagon or one of 27 military bases in the state covering 270,009 acres (1,092.69 km2). Another 139,000 Virginians work for defense contracting firms, which received $44.8 billion worth of contracts in the 2020 fiscal year. Virginia has the second highest concentration of veterans of any state with 9.7% of the population. The Hampton Roads area is home to the world\\'s largest navy base and only <link>NATO</link> station on U.S. soil, Naval Station Norfolk.\\nOther large federal agencies in Northern Virginia include the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, the <link>National Science Foundation</link> and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Alexandria, the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service in Bailey\\'s Crossroads. Virginia\\'s state government employs over 106,000 public employees, who combined have a median income of $52,401 as of 2018, with the Departments of Transportation and of Education the two largest state departments by expenditure. K–12 teachers in Virginia make an annual average of $59,970, which is thirteen-lowest in the U.S. when adjusted for the state\\'s <link>cost of living</link> as of the 2021–22 school year.\\n\\n\\n=== Business ===\\n\\nBased on data as of 2020, Virginia is home to 204,131 separate employers plus 644,341 <link>sole proprietorship</link>s. Of the 144,431 registered non-farm businesses in 2017, 59.4% are majority male-owned, 22% are majority female-owned, 19.6% are majority minority-owned, and 8.9% are veteran-owned. Twenty-four <link>Fortune 500</link> companies are headquartered in Virginia as of 2024, with the largest companies by revenue being <link>Freddie Mac</link>, <link>Boeing</link>, <link>RTX Corporation</link>, <link>Performance Food Group</link>, and <link>Capital One</link>. The two largest by number of employees are <link>Dollar Tree</link> in Chesapeake and <link>Hilton Worldwide Holdings</link> in McLean.\\nVirginia has the third highest concentration of technology workers and the fifth highest overall number among U.S. states as of 2020, with the 451,268 tech jobs accounting for 11.1% of all jobs in the state and earning a median salary of $98,292. Many of these jobs are in Northern Virginia, which hosts a large number of software, communications, and cybersecurity companies, particularly in the <link>Dulles Technology Corridor</link> and Tysons areas. Amazon additionally selected Crystal City for its HQ2 in 2018, while <link>Google</link> expanded their Reston offices in 2019.\\nNorthern Virginia became the world\\'s largest <link>data center</link> market in 2016, with over 47.7 million square feet (4.43 km2) as of 2023, much of it in Loudoun County, which has branded itself \"Data Center Alley\". Data centers in Virginia handled around one-third of all internet traffic and directly employed 13,500 Virginians in 2023 and supported 45,000 total jobs. Virginia had the second fastest average internet speed among U.S. states that year and ninth highest percent of households with broadband access, at 93.6%. Computer chips became the state\\'s highest-grossing export in 2006, and had an estimated export value of $740 million in 2022. Though in the top quartile for diversity based on the <link>Simpson index</link>, only 26% of tech employees in Virginia are women, and only 13% are Black or African American.\\nTourists spent a record $33.3 billion in Virginia in 2023, an increase of 10% from the previous year, supporting an estimated 224,000 jobs, an increase of 13,000. The state ranked as the eighth most visited based on data from 2022. That year saw 745,000 international visitors, with 41% coming from Canada.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\n\\nAs of 2021, agriculture occupies 30% of the land in Virginia with 7.7 million acres (12,031 sq mi; 31,161 km2) of farmland. Nearly 54,000 Virginians work on the state\\'s 41,500 farms, which average 186 acres (0.29 sq mi; 0.75 km2). Though agriculture has declined significantly since 1960, when there were twice as many farms, it remains the largest industry in Virginia, providing for over 490,000 jobs. Soybeans were the most profitable single crop in Virginia in 2022, although the ongoing trade war with China has led many Virginia farmers to plant cotton instead. Other leading agricultural products include corn, cut flowers, and tobacco, where the state ranks third nationally in production.\\nVirginia is the country\\'s third-largest producer of seafood as of 2021, with sea scallops, oysters, Chesapeake blue crabs, <link>menhaden</link>, and hardshell clams as the largest seafood harvests by value, and France, Canada, <link>New Zealand</link>, and <link>Hong Kong</link> as the top export destinations. Commercial fishing supports 18,220 jobs as of 2020, while recreation fishing supports another 5,893. The population of <link>eastern oyster</link>s collapsed in the 1980s due to pollution and overharvesting, but has slowly rebounded, and the 2022–2023 season saw the largest harvest in 35 years with around 700,000 US bushels (25,000 kL). A warm winter and a dry summer made the 2023 wine harvest one of the best for vineyards in the Northern Neck and along the Blue Ridge Mountains, which also attract 2.6 million tourists annually. Virginia has the seventh-highest number of wineries in the nation, with 388 producing 1.1 million cases a year as of 2024. Breweries in Virginia also produced 460,315 barrels (54,017 kl) of craft beer in 2022, the 15th-most nationally.\\n\\n\\n=== Taxes ===\\n\\n<link>State income tax</link> is collected from those with incomes above a filing threshold. There are five income brackets, with rates ranging from 2.0% to 5.75% of taxable income. The state sales and <link>use tax</link> rate is 4.3%, though there is an additional 1% local tax, for a total of a 5.3% combined <link>sales tax</link> on most purchases. Three regions then have a higher sales tax: 6% in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, and 7% in the <link>Historic Triangle</link>. Unlike the majority of states, Virginia does have a 1% sales tax on groceries. This was lowered from 2.5% in January 2023, when the items covered by this lower rate were also extended to include essential personal hygiene goods.\\nVirginia\\'s <link>property tax</link> is set and collected at the local government level and varies throughout the Commonwealth. Real estate is also taxed at the local level. As of 2021, the overall median real estate tax rate per $100 of assessed taxable value was $0.96, though for 72 of the 95 counties this number was under $0.80 per $100. Northern Virginia has the highest property taxes in the state, with Manassas Park paying the highest effective tax rate at $1.31 per $100, while Powhatan and Lunenburg counties were tied for the lowest, at $0.30. Of local government tax revenue, about 61% is generated from real property taxes while 24% is from tangible personal property, sales and use, and business license tax. The remaining 15% come from taxes on hotels, restaurant meals, public service corporation property, and consumer utilities.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\nModern Virginian culture has many sources and is part of the <link>culture of the Southern United States</link>. The <link>Smithsonian Institution</link> divides Virginia into nine cultural regions.\\nBesides the general <link>cuisine of the Southern United States</link>, Virginians maintain their own particular traditions. <link>Virginia wine</link> is made in many parts of the Commonwealth. <link>Smithfield ham</link>, sometimes called \"Virginia ham\", is a type of <link>country ham</link> which is protected by state law and can be produced only in the town of Smithfield. <link>Virginia furniture</link> and architecture are typical of <link>American colonial architecture</link>. Thomas Jefferson and many of the Commonwealth\\'s early leaders favored the <link>Neoclassical architecture</link> style, leading to its use for important state buildings. The <link>Pennsylvania Dutch</link> and their style can also be found in parts of the Commonwealth.\\nLiterature in Virginia often deals with the Commonwealth\\'s past. The works of <link>Pulitzer Prize</link> winner <link>Ellen Glasgow</link> often dealt with social inequalities and the role of women in her culture. <link>James Branch Cabell</link> wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry in the Reconstruction era, and challenged its moral code with <link>Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice</link>. <link>William Styron</link> approached history in works such as The Confessions of Nat Turner and Sophie\\'s Choice. <link>Tom Wolfe</link> has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like <link>I Am Charlotte Simmons</link>. <link>Matt Bondurant</link> received critical acclaim for his historic novel <link>The Wettest County in the World</link> about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.\\n\\n\\n=== Fine and performing arts ===\\n\\nVirginia ranks near the middle of U.S. states in terms of public spending on the arts as of 2021, at just over half of the national average. The state government does fund some institutions, including the <link>Virginia Museum of Fine Arts</link> and the <link>Science Museum of Virginia</link>. Other museums include the <link>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center</link> of the <link>National Air and Space Museum</link> and the <link>Chrysler Museum of Art</link>. Besides these sites, many open-air museums are located in the Commonwealth, such as <link>Colonial Williamsburg</link>, the Frontier Culture Museum, and various historic battlefields. The <link>Virginia Foundation for the Humanities</link> works to improve the Commonwealth\\'s civic, cultural, and intellectual life.\\nThe <link>Harrison Opera House</link>, in Norfolk, is home of the <link>Virginia Opera</link>. The <link>Virginia Symphony Orchestra</link> operates in and around Hampton Roads. Resident and touring theater troupes operate from the <link>American Shakespeare Center</link> in Staunton. The <link>Barter Theatre</link> in Abingdon, designated the State Theatre of Virginia, won the first <link>Regional Theatre Tony Award</link> in 1948, while the Signature Theatre in Arlington won it in 2009. There is also a Children\\'s Theater of Virginia, <link>Theatre IV</link>, which is the second-largest touring troupe in the nation. Notable music performance venues include <link>The Birchmere</link>, the Landmark Theater, and <link>Jiffy Lube Live</link>. <link>Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts</link> is located in Vienna and is the only national park intended for use as a performing arts center.\\nVirginia is known for its tradition in the music genres of old-time string and bluegrass, with groups such as the <link>Carter Family</link> and <link>Stanley Brothers</link> achieving national prominence during the 1940s. The state\\'s African tradition is found through gospel, <link>blues</link>, and <link>shout band</link>s, with both <link>Ella Fitzgerald</link> and <link>Pearl Bailey</link> coming from Newport News. Contemporary Virginia is also known for <link>folk rock</link> artists like <link>Dave Matthews</link> and <link>Jason Mraz</link>, R&B artists <link>Chris Brown</link>, <link>D\\'Angelo</link>, and <link>Kali Uchis</link>, hip hop stars like <link>Pharrell Williams</link>, <link>Timbaland</link>, <link>Missy Elliott</link> and <link>Pusha T</link>, as well as <link>thrash metal</link> groups like <link>GWAR</link> and Lamb of God. Several members of <link>country music</link> band Old Dominion grew up in the Roanoke area, and took their band name from Virginia\\'s state nickname.\\n\\n\\n=== Festivals ===\\n\\nMany counties and localities host <link>county fair</link>s and festivals. The <link>Virginia State Fair</link> is held at the <link>Meadow Event Park</link> every September. Also in September is the <link>Neptune Festival</link> in Virginia Beach, which celebrates the city, the waterfront, and regional artists. Norfolk\\'s Harborfest, in June, features boat racing and <link>air show</link>s. Fairfax County also sponsors Celebrate Fairfax! with popular and traditional music performances. The Virginia Lake Festival is held in July in Clarksville. The Eastern Shore island of Chincoteague hosts the annual <link>Pony Penning</link> of feral Chincoteague ponies, expanded into a week-long carnival. Every year on Thanksgiving in Richmond, the Mattaponi and Pamunkey tribes present Virginia\\'s governor with a tribute of deer in a celebration honoring colonial treaties.\\nThe <link>Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival</link> is a two-week festival held annually in Winchester which includes parades and bluegrass concerts. The Old Time Fiddlers\\' Convention in Galax, begun in 1935, is one of the oldest and largest such events worldwide. Wolf Trap hosts the <link>Wolf Trap Opera Company</link>, which produces an opera festival every summer. The Blue Ridge Rock Festival has operated since 2017, and has brought as many as 33,000 concert-goers to the Blue Ridge Amphitheater in Pittsylvania County. Two important film festivals, the <link>Virginia Film Festival</link> and the <link>VCU French Film Festival</link>, are held annually in Charlottesville and Richmond, respectively.\\n\\n\\n== Law and government ==\\n\\nIn 1619, the first Virginia General Assembly met, making Virginia\\'s legislature the oldest of its kind in North America. The government today functions under the seventh <link>Constitution of Virginia</link>, which was approved by voters in 1970 and went into effect in July 1971. It is similar to the federal structure in that it provides for three branches: a strong legislature, an executive, and a unified judicial system.\\nVirginia\\'s legislature is <link>bicameral</link>, with a 100-member House of Delegates and 40-member Senate, who together write the laws for the Commonwealth. Delegates serve two-year terms, while senators serve four-year terms, with the most recent elections for both taking place in November 2023. The executive department includes the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general, who are elected every four years in separate elections, with the next taking place in November 2025. Incumbent governors cannot run for re-election; governors can and have served non-consecutive terms. The lieutenant governor is the official head of the Senate and is responsible for breaking ties. The House elects a Speaker of the House and the Senate elects a President pro tempore, who presides when the lieutenant governor is not present, and both houses elect a clerk and majority and minority leaders. The governor also nominates their 16 cabinet members and others who head various state departments.\\nThe legislature starts regular sessions on the second Wednesday of every year. They meet for up to 48 days in odd years, which are election years, or 60 days in even years, to allow more time for biennial state budgets, which governors propose. After regular sessions end, special sessions can be called either by the governor or with agreement of two-thirds of both houses, and 21 special sessions have been called since 2000, typically for legislation on preselected issues. Though not a full-time legislature, the Assembly is classified as a hybrid because special sessions are not limited by the state constitution and often last several months. A one-day \"veto session\" is also automatically triggered when a governor chooses to veto or return legislation to the Assembly with amendments. Vetoes can then be overturned with approval of two-thirds of both the House and Senate. A bill that passes with two-thirds approval can also become law without action from the governor, and Virginia has no \"<link>pocket veto</link>\", so bills become law if the governor chooses to neither approve nor veto them.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal system ===\\n\\nThe judges and justices who make up Virginia\\'s judicial system, also the oldest in America, are elected by a majority vote in both the House and Senate without input from the governor, one way Virginia\\'s legislature is stronger than its executive. The governor can make <link>recess appointment</link>s, and when both branches are controlled by the same party, the assembly often confirms them. The judicial hierarchy starts with the General District Courts and Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts, with the Circuit Courts above them, then the <link>Court of <link>Appeal</link>s of Virginia</link>, and the <link>Supreme Court of Virginia</link> on top. The Supreme Court has seven justices who serve 12-year terms, with a <link>mandatory retirement age</link> of 73; they select their own chief justice, who is informally limited to two four-year terms. Virginia was the last state to guarantee an automatic right of appeal for all civil and criminal cases. Its Court of Appeals increased from 11 to 17 judges in 2021.\\nThe <link>Code of Virginia</link> is the statutory law and consists of the codified legislation of the General Assembly. The largest law enforcement agency in Virginia is the <link>Virginia State Police</link>, with 3,035 sworn and civilian members as of 2019. The <link>Virginia Marine Police</link> were founded as the \"Oyster Navy\" in 1864 in response to oyster bed poaching. The Virginia Capitol Police protect the legislature and executive department, and are the oldest police department in the United States, dating to the guards who protected the colonial leadership. The governor can also call upon the <link>Virginia National Guard</link>, which consists of approximately 7,200 army soldiers, 1,200 airmen, 300 Defense Force members, and 400 civilians.\\nBetween 1608 and 2021, when the death penalty was abolished, the state executed over 1,300 people, including 113 following the resumption of capital punishment in 1982. Virginia\\'s prison system incarcerates 30,936 people as of 2018, 53% of whom are Black, and the state has the sixteenth-highest rate of incarceration in the country, at 422 per 100,000 residents. Prisoner <link>parole</link> was ended in 1995, and Virginia\\'s rate of <link>recidivism</link> of released felons who are re-convicted within three years and sentenced to a year or more is 23.1%, the lowest in the country as of 2019. Virginia has the fourth lowest violent crime rate and thirteenth lowest property crime rate as of 2018. Between 2008 and 2017, arrests for drug-related crimes rose 38%, with 71% of those related to marijuana, which Virginia decriminalized in July 2020 and legalized in July 2021.\\n\\n\\n== Politics ==\\n\\nOver the past century, Virginia has shifted politically from being a largely rural, conservative, Southern bloc member to a state that is more urbanized, pluralistic, and politically moderate, as both greater enfranchisement and demographic shifts have changed the electorate. Up until the 1970s, Virginia was a racially divided one-party state dominated by the Byrd Organization. They sought to stymie the political power of Northern Virginia, perpetuate segregation, and successfully restricted voter registration such that between 1905 and 1948 <link>voter turnout</link> was regularly below ten percent. The organization used <link>malapportionment</link> to manipulate what areas were over-represented in the General Assembly and the U.S. Congress until ordered to end the practice by the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision in <link>Davis v. Mann</link> and the 1965 <link>Virginia Supreme Court</link> decision in Wilkins v. Davis respectively.\\nEnforcement of federal civil rights legislation passed in the mid-1960s helped overturn the state\\'s Jim Crow laws that effectively disenfranchised African Americans. The <link>Voting Rights Act of 1965</link> made Virginia one of nine states that were required to receive federal approval for changes to voting laws, until the system for including states was struck down in 2013. The <link>Voting Rights Act of Virginia</link> was passed in 2021, requiring preclearance from the state Attorney General for local election changes that could result in disenfranchisement, including closing or moving polling sites. Though many Jim Crow provisions were removed in Virginia\\'s 1971 constitution, a lifetime ban on voting for felony convictions was unchanged, and by 2016, up to twenty percent of African Americans in Virginia were disenfranchised because of prior felonies. That year, Governor <link>Terry McAuliffe</link> ended the lifetime ban and individually restored voting rights to over 200,000 ex-felons. Virginia moved from being ranked as the second most difficult state to vote in 2016, to the twelfth easiest in 2020.\\nWhile urban and expanding suburban areas, including much of Northern Virginia, form the modern Democratic Party base, rural southern and western areas moved to support the Republican Party in response to its \"<link>southern strategy</link>\" starting around 1970. Rural Democratic support has nevertheless persisted in union-influenced Roanoke, college towns such as Charlottesville and Blacksburg, and the southeastern Black Belt Region. African Americans are the most reliable bloc of Democratic voters, but educational attainment and gender have also become strong indicators of political alignment, with the majority of women in Virginia supporting Democratic presidential candidates since 1980. International immigration and domestic migration into Virginia have also increased the proportion of eligible voters born outside the state from 44% in 1980 to 55% in 2019.\\n\\n\\n=== State elections ===\\n\\nBecause Virginia enacted their post-Civil-War constitution in 1870, state <link>elections in Virginia</link> occur in odd-numbered years, with executive department elections occurring in years following U.S. presidential elections and State Senate elections occurring in the years prior to presidential elections. House of Delegates elections take place concurrent with each of those elections. National politics often play a role in state election outcomes, and Virginians have elected governors of the party opposite the U.S. president in eleven of the last twelve contests, with only Terry McAuliffe beating the trend in 2013.\\nThe 2017 state elections resulted in Democrats holding the three executive offices, as lieutenant governor <link>Ralph Northam</link> won the race for governor. In concurrent House of Delegates elections, Democrats flipped fifteen of the Republicans\\' previous sixteen-seat majority. Control of the House came down to a tied election in the 94th district, which the Republican won by a drawing of lots, giving the party a slim 51–49 majority in the 2018–19 legislative sessions. At this time, Virginia was ranked as having the most gerrymandered U.S. state legislature, as Republicans controlled the House with only 44.5% of the total vote. In 2019, federal courts found that eleven House district lines, including the 94th, were unconstitutionally drawn to discriminate against African Americans. Adjusted districts were used in the 2019 elections, when Democrats won full control of the General Assembly, despite a political crisis earlier that year. Voters in 2020 then passed a referendum to give control of drawing both state and congressional districts to a commission of eight citizens and four legislators from each of the two major parties, rather than the legislature.\\nIn 2021, <link>Glenn Youngkin</link> became the first Republican to win the governor\\'s race since 2009, with his party also winning the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general and gaining seven seats in the House of Delegates. Two years later, new legislative maps drawn by <link>special master</link>s appointed by the state supreme court led to nine retirements in the state senate and to twenty-five House delegates not seeking re-election. In those elections, Democrats claimed a slim majority of one seat in both the Senate and the House.\\n\\n\\n=== Federal elections ===\\n\\nThough Virginia was considered a \"<link>swing state</link>\" in the 2008 presidential election, Virginia\\'s thirteen electoral votes were carried in that election and the four since then by Democratic candidates, suggesting the state has shifted to being reliably Democratic in presidential elections. Virginia was the only former Confederate state to vote for the Democrats in the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections. Virginia had previously voted for Republican presidential candidates in thirteen out of fourteen presidential elections from 1952 to 2004, including ten in a row from 1968 to 2004. Virginia currently holds its presidential open primary election on <link>Super Tuesday</link>, the same day as fourteen other states, with the most recent held on March 5, 2024.\\nVirginia\\'s two U.S. senators are in classes 1 and 2. Virginia has had eleven U.S. House of Representatives seats since 1993, and control of the majority has flipped four times since then, often as part of \"wave elections\". Currently, Democrats and Republicans both hold five seat, with one vacant following the death of <link>Gerald Connolly</link>.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n\\nVirginia\\'s educational system consistently ranks in the top five states on the U.S. Department of Education\\'s <link>National Assessment of Educational Progress</link>, with Virginia students outperforming the average in all subject areas and grade levels tested. Virginia\\'s K–7 schools had a <link>student–teacher ratio</link> of 12.41:1 as of the 2022–23 school year, and 12.52:1 for grades 8–12. All school divisions must adhere to educational standards set forth by the <link>Virginia Department of Education</link>, which maintains an assessment and accreditation regime known as the <link>Standards of Learning</link>.\\nPublic K–12 schools in Virginia are generally operated by the counties and cities, and not by the state. As of the 2023–24 academic year, 1,261,962 students were enrolled in 2,254 local and regional schools in the Commonwealth, including 56 career and technical schools and 290 alternative and special education centers across 126 school divisions. Besides the general public schools in Virginia, there are Governor\\'s Schools and selective <link>magnet school</link>s. The Governor\\'s Schools are a collection of 52 regional high schools and summer programs intended for gifted students, and include the <link>Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</link>, the top-rated high school in the country in 2022. The Virginia Council for Private Education oversees the regulation of 483 state accredited private schools. An additional 53,680 students receive homeschooling.\\nIn 2022, 92.1% of high school students graduated on-time after four years, and 89.3% of adults over the age 25 had their high school diploma. Virginia has one of the smaller racial gaps in graduation rates among U.S. states, with 90.3% of Black students graduating on time, compared to 94.9% of white students and 98.3% of Asian students. Hispanic students had the highest dropout rate, at 13.95%, with high rates being correlated with students listed as English learners. Despite ending school segregation in the 1960s, seven percent of Virginia\\'s public schools were rated as \"intensely segregated\" by The Civil Rights Project at UCLA in 2019, and the number has risen since 1989, when only three percent were. Virginia has comparatively large public school districts, typically comprising entire counties or cities, and this helps mitigate funding gaps seen in other states such that non-white districts average slightly more funding, $255 per student as of 2019, than majority white districts. Elementary schools, with Virginia\\'s smallest districts, were found to be more segregated than state middle or high schools by a 2019 VCU study.\\n\\n\\n=== Colleges and universities ===\\n\\nAs of 2020, Virginia has the sixth-highest percent of residents with bachelor\\'s degrees or higher, with 39.5%. The Department of Education recognizes 163 colleges and universities in Virginia. In the 2022 <link>U.S. News & World Report</link> ranking of national public universities, the <link>University of Virginia</link> is ranked 3rd, the <link>College of William and Mary</link> is 13th, Virginia Tech is 23rd, <link>George Mason University</link> is 65th, <link>James Madison University</link> is 72nd, and <link>Virginia Commonwealth University</link> is 83rd. There are 119 private institutions in the state, including <link>Washington and Lee University</link> and the <link>University of Richmond</link>, which are ranked as the country\\'s 11th and 18th best liberal arts colleges respectively.\\nVirginia Tech and <link>Virginia State University</link> are the state\\'s land-grant universities, and Virginia State is one of its five <link>historically black colleges and universities</link>. The <link>Virginia Military Institute</link> is the oldest state military college. Virginia also operates 23 community colleges on 40 campuses which enrolled 199,926 degree-seeking students during the 2021–2022 school year. In 2021, the state made community college free for most low- and middle-income students. George Mason University had the largest on-campus enrollment at 40,390 students as of 2023, though the private Liberty University had the largest total enrollment in the state, with 115,000 online and 15,800 on-campus students in Lynchburg as of 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Health ==\\n\\nVirginia was ranked best for its physical environment in the 2024 United Health Foundation\\'s Health Rankings, but 15th for its overall health outcomes and only 23rd for residents\\' healthy behaviors. Among U.S. states, Virginia has the 20th-lowest rate of premature deaths, with 8,146 per 100,000, and an <link>infant mortality</link> rate of 5.61 per 1,000 live births. The rate of uninsured Virginians dropped to 6.4% in 2024, following an expansion of Medicare in 2019. Falls Church and Loudoun County were both ranked in the top ten healthiest communities in 2020 by U.S. News & World Report.\\nWith high rates of heart disease and diabetes, African Americans in Virginia have an average life expectancy four years less than whites and twelve less than Asian Americans and Latinos, and were disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic. African-American mothers are also three times more likely to die while giving birth. Mortality rates among white middle-class Virginians have also been rising, with drug overdose, alcohol poisoning, and suicide as leading causes. Suicides in the state increased over 14% between 2009 and 2023, while deaths from drug overdoses more than doubled. Virginia has a ratio of 274.3 <link>primary care physician</link>s per 10,000 residents and only 273.1 mental health providers per that number, both fourteenth worst nationwide. A December 2023 report by the General Assembly found that all nine public mental health care facilities were over 95% full, causing overcrowding and delays in admissions.\\nWeight is an issue for many Virginians: 32.2% of adults and 14.9% of 10- to 17-year-olds are obese as of 2021, 35% of adults are overweight, and 23.3% do not exercise regularly. Smoking in bars and restaurants was banned in January 2010, and the percent of tobacco smokers in the state has declined from 19% in that year to 12.1% in 2023, but an additional 7.7% use <link>e-cigarette</link>s. The percentage of adults who receive annual immunizations is above average, as 48.1% get their yearly flu vaccination. In 2008, Virginia became the first U.S. state to mandate the <link>HPV vaccine</link> for girls for school attendance, and 62.9% of adolescents have the vaccine as of 2024.\\nThe <link>Virginia Board of Health</link> regulates healthcare facilities. There are 88 hospitals in Virginia with a combined 17,024 hospital beds as of 2023. The largest in both Virginia and the Washington metropolitan area is <link>Inova Fairfax Hospital</link>, which serves over 55,000 patients annually. <link>VCU Medical Center</link>, where a new 16-story <link>children\\'s hospital</link> was opened in 2023, is highly ranked for <link>pediatrics</link>, while UVA Medical Center is highly ranked for its cancer care, and the state numbers in the top ten for annual <link>cancer screening</link>s. <link>Sentara Norfolk General Hospital</link>, a teaching institution of <link>Eastern Virginia Medical School</link>, was the site of the first successful U.S. <link>in-vitro fertilization</link> program, and around 2.5% of births in the state are due to IVF.\\n\\n\\n== Media ==\\n\\nThe Hampton Roads area is the 44th-largest <link>media market</link> in the United States as ranked by <link>Nielsen Media Research</link>, while the <link>Richmond-Petersburg</link> area is 56th and Roanoke-Lynchburg is 71st as of 2022. Northern Virginia is part of the much larger Washington, D.C. media market, which is the country\\'s ninth-largest.\\nThere are 36 television stations in Virginia, representing each major U.S. network, part of 42 stations which serve Virginia viewers including those broadcasting from neighboring jurisdictions. There are 595 FCC-licensed FM radio stations broadcast in Virginia and 239 AM stations as of 2020. The nationally available <link>Public Broadcasting Service</link> (PBS) is headquartered in Arlington. Independent <link>PBS</link> affiliates exist throughout Virginia, and the Arlington PBS member station <link>WETA-TV</link> produces programs such as the <link>PBS NewsHour</link> and <link>Washington Week</link>.\\nThe most circulated native newspapers in the Commonwealth are Norfolk\\'s <link>The Virginian-Pilot</link> with around 132,000 subscribers, the <link>Richmond Times-Dispatch</link> with 86,219, and <link>The Roanoke Times</link> as of 2018. <link>USA Today</link>, which is headquartered in McLean, has seen its daily subscription number decline significantly from over 500,000 in 2019 to just over 180,000 in 2021, but is still the third-most circulated paper nationwide. USA Today is the flagship publication of <link>Gannett</link>, Inc., which merged with <link>GateHouse Media</link> in 2019, and operates over one hundred local newspapers nationwide. In Northern Virginia, <link>The Washington Post</link> is the dominant newspaper and provides local coverage for the region. Politico and Axios, which both cover national politics, have their headquarters in Arlington.\\n\\n\\n== Transportation ==\\n\\nBecause of the 1932 <link>Byrd Road Act</link>, the state government controls most of Virginia\\'s roads, instead of a local county authority as is usual in other states. As of 2018, the <link>Virginia Department of Transportation</link> (VDOT) owns and operates 57,867 miles (93,128 km) of the total 70,105 miles (112,823 km) of roads in the state, making it the third-largest state highway system.\\nTraffic on Virginia\\'s roads is among the worst in the nation according to the 2019 <link>American Community Survey</link>. The average commute time of 28.7 minutes is the eighth-longest among U.S. states, and the Washington Metropolitan Area, which includes Northern Virginia, has the second-worst rate of traffic congestion among U.S. cities. About 68.4% of workers in Virginia reported driving alone to work in 2024, the fifteenth lowest percent in the U.S., while 8.2% reported carpooling, and Virginia hit <link>peak car</link> usage before the year 2000, making it one of the first such states.\\n\\n\\n=== Mass transit and ports ===\\nAbout 3.4% of Virginians commute on public transit, and there were over 171.9 million public transit trips in Virginia in 2019, over 62% of which were done on the <link>Washington Metro</link> transit system, which serves Arlington and Alexandria, and extends into Loudoun and Fairfax Counties. Commuter buses include the <link>Fairfax Connector</link>, FRED buses in Fredericksburg, and OmniRide in Prince William County, while the state-run <link>Virginia Breeze</link> buses run four inter-city routes from Washington, D.C. to Bristol, Blacksburg, Martinsville, and Danville. VDOT operates several free ferries throughout Virginia, the most notable being the <link>Jamestown Ferry</link> which connects Jamestown to Scotland Wharf across the <link>James River</link>.\\nVirginia has <link>Amtrak</link> passenger rail service along several corridors, and <link>Virginia Railway Express</link> (VRE) maintains two commuter lines into Washington, D.C. from Fredericksburg and Manassas. VRE experienced a dramatic decline in ridership due to the <link>COVID-19</link> pandemic, with daily ridership dropping from over 18,000 in 2019 to 6,864 in February 2024. Amtrak routes in Virginia have however passed their pre-pandemic levels and served 123,658 passengers in March 2024. Norfolk operates a light rail system called The Tide, servicing about 2,300 people per day. Major freight railroads in Virginia include <link>Norfolk Southern</link> and <link>CSX Transportation</link>, and in 2021 the state finalized a deal to purchase 223 miles (359 km) of track and over 350 miles (560 km) of right of way from CSX for future passenger rail service.\\nVirginia has five major airports: Dulles International and Reagan Washington National in Northern Virginia, both of which handle over 20 million passengers a year, Richmond International southeast of the state capital, <link>Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport</link>, and Norfolk International. Several other airports offer limited commercial passenger service, and sixty-six public airports serve the state\\'s aviation needs. The <link>Virginia Port Authority</link>\\'s main seaports are those in Hampton Roads, which carried 61,505,700 <link>short ton</link>s (55,797,000 t) of total cargo in 2021, the sixth most of United States ports. The <link>Eastern Shore of Virginia</link> is the site of <link>Wallops Flight Facility</link>, a rocket launch center owned by <link>NASA</link>, and the <link>Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport</link>, a commercial spaceport. <link>Space tourism</link> is also offered through Vienna-based <link>Space Adventures</link>.\\n\\n\\n== Sports ==\\n\\nVirginia is the most populous U.S. state without a major professional sports league franchise. The reasons for this include the lack of any dominant city or market within the state and the proximity of teams in Washington, D.C., <link>Baltimore</link>, Charlotte, and Raleigh, as well as a reluctance to publicly finance stadiums. A proposed $220 million NBA arena in Virginia Beach lost the support of the city council there in 2017, while a 2023 proposal to move the NBA\\'s <link>Washington Wizards</link> and the NHL\\'s <link>Washington Capitals</link> to Alexandria was canceled after opposition in the <link>Virginia Senate</link>.\\nFive <link>minor league baseball</link> and two mid-level hockey teams play in Virginia. Norfolk is host to two: The Triple-A <link>Norfolk Tides</link> and the <link>ECHL</link>\\'s Norfolk Admirals. The Double-A <link>Richmond Flying Squirrels</link> began playing at The Diamond in 2010, while the <link>Fredericksburg Nationals</link>, <link>Lynchburg Hillcats</link>, and <link>Salem Red Sox</link> play in the <link>Low-A East</link> league. <link>Loudoun United FC</link>, the reserve team of <link>D.C. United</link>, debuted in the <link>USL Championship</link> in 2019, while the <link>Richmond Kickers</link> of the <link>USL League One</link> have operated since 1993 and are the only team in their league to win both the league championship and the <link>U.S. Open Cup</link> in the same year. The training facilities for both the <link>Washington Commanders</link> and <link>Washington Spirit</link> are in Loudoun County, while the Washington Capitals practice at <link>MedStar Capitals Iceplex</link> in Ballston.\\nHampton Roads has produced several Olympic gold medalists, including <link>Gabby Douglas</link>, the first African American to win gymnastics individual all-around gold, and <link>LaShawn Merritt</link>, <link>Francena McCorory</link>, and Michael Cherry, who have all won gold in the <link>4 × 400 meters relay</link>. <link>Noah Lyles</link>, reigning \"world\\'s fastest man\" and winner of the 100 meter dash at the 2024 Olympics, grew up in Alexandria. Major long-distance races in the state include the <link>Richmond Marathon</link>, the <link>Blue Ridge Marathon on the Parkway</link>, and the <link>Monument Avenue 10K</link>. Virginia\\'s professional caliber golf courses include <link>Kingsmill Resort</link> outside Williamsburg, which hosts an LPGA Tour tournament in May, and the <link>Country Club of Virginia</link> outside Richmond, which hosts a charity classic on the <link>PGA Tour Champions</link> in October. Notable PGA Tour winners from Virginia include <link>Sam Snead</link> and <link>Curtis Strange</link>. <link>NASCAR</link> currently schedules Cup Series races on two tracks in Virginia: <link>Martinsville Speedway</link> and <link>Richmond Raceway</link>. Notable drivers from Virginia in the series have included <link>Jeff Burton</link>, <link>Ward Burton</link>, <link>Denny Hamlin</link>, <link>Wendell Scott</link> and <link>Curtis Turner</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== College sports ===\\n\\nSeveral of Virginia\\'s collegiate sports programs have attracted strong followings, with a 2015 poll showing that 34% of Virginians were fans of the <link>Virginia Cavaliers</link> and 28% were fans of the rival <link>Virginia Tech Hokies</link>, making both more popular than the surveyed regional professional teams. The men\\'s and women\\'s <link>college basketball</link> programs of the Cavaliers, VCU Rams, and Old Dominion Monarchs have combined for 66 regular season conference championships and 49 conference tournament championships between them as of 2023. The Hokies football team sustained a 27-year bowl streak between 1993 and 2019; <link>James Madison Dukes football</link> won FCS NCAA Championships in both 2004 and 2016. The overall UVA men\\'s athletics programs won the national Capital One Cup in both 2015 and 2019, and led the <link>Atlantic Coast Conference</link> in NCAA championships.\\nFourteen universities in total compete in <link>NCAA Division I</link>, with multiple programs each in the Atlantic Coast Conference, <link>Atlantic 10 Conference</link>, <link>Big South Conference</link>, and <link>Coastal Athletic Association</link>. Three historically Black schools compete in the Division II <link>Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association</link>, and two others (Hampton and Norfolk State) compete in Division I. Several smaller schools compete in the <link>Old Dominion Athletic Conference</link> and the <link>USA South Athletic Conference</link> of NCAA Division III. The NCAA currently holds its Division III championships in football, men\\'s <link>basketball</link>, volleyball, and softball in Salem. State appropriated funds are not allowed to be used for either operational or capital expenses for intercollegiate athletics.\\n\\n\\n=== High school sports ===\\nVirginia is also home to several of the nation\\'s top high school basketball programs, including <link>Paul VI Catholic High School</link> and Oak Hill Academy, the latter of which has won nine national championships. In the 2022–2023 school year, 176,623 high school students participated in fourteen girls sports and thirteen boys sports managed by the <link>Virginia High School League</link>, with the most popular sports being football, outdoor track and cross country, soccer, basketball, baseball and softball, and volleyball. Outside of the high school system, 145 youth soccer clubs operate in the Virginia Youth Soccer Association, under the USYS system, as of 2024.\\n\\n\\n== State symbols ==\\n\\nVirginia has several nicknames, the oldest of which is the \"Old Dominion\". King <link>Charles II of England</link> first referred to \"our auntient Collonie of Virginia\" one of \"our own Dominions\" in 1662 or 1663, perhaps choosing this language because Virginia was home to many of his supporters during the English Civil War. These supporters were called Cavaliers, and the nickname \"The Cavalier State\" was popularized after the American Civil War. Virginia has also been called the \"Mother of Presidents\", as eight Virginians have served as President of the United States, including four of the first five.\\nThe state\\'s motto, <link>Sic Semper Tyrannis</link>, translates from <link>Latin</link> as \"Thus Always to Tyrants\", and is used on the state seal, which is then used on the flag. While the seal was designed in 1776, and the flag was first used in the 1830s, both were made official in 1930. In 1940, \"<link>Carry Me Back to Old Virginny</link>\" was named the state song, but it was retired in 1997 due to its nostalgic references to slavery. In March 2015, Virginia\\'s government named \"<link>Our Great Virginia</link>\", which uses the tune of \"<link>Oh Shenandoah</link>\", as the traditional state song and \"<link>Sweet Virginia Breeze</link>\" as the popular state song.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n<link>Index of Virginia-related articles</link>\\n<link>Outline of Virginia</link>\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n\\n=== Government ===\\nState Government website\\nVirginia General Assembly\\nVirginia\\'s Judicial system\\n\\n\\n=== Tourism and recreation ===\\nVirginia Tourism Website\\nVirginia State Parks\\n<link>Virginia Wildlife Management Areas</link>\\n\\n\\n=== Culture and history ===\\nLibrary of Virginia\\nVirginia Museum of Culture and History\\nEncyclopedia Virginia\\n\\n\\n=== Maps and demographics ===\\nUSGS geographic resources of Virginia\\nVirginia State Climatology Office Archived October 5, 2006, at the <link>Wayback Machine</link>\\nVirginia State Facts from USDA, Economic Research Service\\n Geographic data related to Virginia at OpenStreetMap', 'tool_call_id': 'call_Fe4MMesXhCDng4eDrIbKd6I9', 'name': 'get_content'}\n",

In the provinces of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, the term \"shire town\" is used in place of county seat.\\n\\n\\n== China ==\\n\\nCounty seats in China are the administrative centers of the counties in the People\\'s Republic of China.\\nThey have existed since the <link>Warring States period</link> and were set up nationwide by the <link>Qin dynasty</link>. The number of counties in <link>China proper</link> gradually increased from dynasty to dynasty. As <link>Qin Shi Huang</link> reorganized the counties after his unification, there were about 1,000. Under the Eastern <link>Han dynasty</link>, the number of counties increased to above 1,000. About 1400 existed when the <link>Sui dynasty</link> abolished the commandery level (郡 jùn), which was the level just above counties, and demoted some commanderies to counties. \\nIn Imperial China, the county was a significant administrative unit because it marked the lowest level of the imperial bureaucratic structure; in other words, it was the lowest level that the government reached. Government below the county level was often undertaken through informal non-bureaucratic means, varying between dynasties. The head of a county was the magistrate, who oversaw both the day-to-day operations of the county as well as civil and criminal cases.\\nThe current number of counties mostly resembled that of the later years of the <link>Qing dynasty</link>. Changes of location and names of counties in Chinese history have been a major field of research in Chinese historical geography, especially from the 1960s to the 1980s. There are 1,355 counties in <link>Mainland China</link> out of a total of 2,851 county-level divisions.\\n\\n\\n== <link>Taiwan</link> ==\\n\\nIn Taiwan, the first counties were first established in 1661 by the <link>Kingdom of Tungning</link>. The later ruler Qing empire inherited this type of administrative divisions. With the increase of <link>Han Chinese</link> population in Taiwan, the number of counties also grew by time. By the end of Qing era, there were 11 counties in Taiwan. Protestant missionaries in China first romanized the term as hien. When Taiwan became a Japanese colony in 1895, the hierarchy of divisions also incorporated into the Japanese system in the period when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. \\nBy September 1945, Taiwan was divided into 8 prefectures (州 and 廳), which remained after the Republic of China took over. \\nThere are 13 county seats in Taiwan, which function as county-administered cities, urban townships, or rural townships.\\n\\n\\n=== Lists of county seats ===\\n\\n\\n== United States ==\\n\\n\\n=== Function ===\\n\\nIn most of the United States, a county is an administrative or political subdivision of a state that consists of a geographic area with specific boundaries and usually some level of governmental authority. The city, town, or populated place that houses county government is known as the seat of its county. Generally, the county legislature, <link>county courthouse</link>, sheriff\\'s department headquarters, hall of records, jail and <link>correctional facility</link> are located in the county seat, though some functions (such as highway maintenance, which usually requires a large garage for vehicles, along with asphalt and salt storage facilities) may also be located or conducted in other parts of the county, especially if it is geographically large.\\nA county seat is usually an incorporated <link>municipality</link>. The exceptions include the county seats of counties that have no incorporated municipalities within their <link>border</link>s, such as <link>Arlington County, Virginia</link>, where the county seat is the entire county. Ellicott City, the county seat of <link>Howard County, Maryland</link>, is the largest unincorporated county seat in the United States, followed by Towson, the county seat of <link>Baltimore County, Maryland</link>. Likewise, some county seats may not be incorporated in their own right, but are located within incorporated municipalities. For example, <link>Cape May Court House, New Jersey</link>, though unincorporated, is a section of Middle Township, an incorporated municipality. In some states, often those that were among the original <link>Thirteen Colonies</link>, county seats include or formerly included \"Court House\" as part of their name, such as <link>Spotsylvania Courthouse, Virginia</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== U.S. counties with more than one county seat ===\\nMost counties have only one county seat. However, some counties in <link>Alabama</link>, <link>Arkansas</link>, Georgia, <link>Iowa</link>, <link>Kentucky</link>, <link>Massachusetts</link>, <link>Mississippi</link>, <link>Missouri</link>, <link>New Hampshire</link>, New York, and Vermont have two or more county seats, usually located on opposite sides of the county. Examples include <link>Harrison County, Mississippi</link>, which has both Biloxi and Gulfport as county seats, and <link>Hinds County, Mississippi</link>, which has both Raymond and the state capital of Jackson. The practice of multiple county seat towns dates from the days when travel was difficult. There have been few efforts to eliminate the two-seat arrangement, since a county seat is a source of civic pride for the towns involved, along with providing employment opportunities.\\nThere are 33 counties with multiple county seats in 11 states:\\n\\n<link>Coffee County, Alabama</link>\\n<link>St. Clair County, Alabama</link>\\n<link>Arkansas County, Arkansas</link>\\n<link>Carroll County, Arkansas</link>\\n<link>Clay County, Arkansas</link>\\n<link>Craighead County, Arkansas</link>\\n<link>Franklin County, Arkansas</link>\\n<link>Logan County, Arkansas</link>\\n<link>Mississippi County, Arkansas</link>\\n<link>Prairie County, Arkansas</link>\\n<link>Sebastian County, Arkansas</link>\\n<link>Yell County, Arkansas</link>\\n<link>Columbia County, Georgia</link>\\n<link>Lee County, Iowa</link>\\n<link>Campbell County, Kentucky</link>\\n<link>Kenton County, Kentucky</link>\\n<link>Essex County, Massachusetts</link>\\n<link>Middlesex County, Massachusetts</link>\\n<link>Plymouth County, Massachusetts</link>\\n<link>Bolivar County, Mississippi</link>\\n<link>Carroll County, Mississippi</link>\\n<link>Chickasaw County, Mississippi</link>\\nHarrison County, Mississippi\\nHinds County, Mississippi\\n<link>Jasper County, Mississippi</link>\\n<link>Jones County, Mississippi</link>\\n<link>Panola County, Mississippi</link>\\n<link>Tallahatchie County, Mississippi</link>\\n<link>Yalobusha County, Mississippi</link>\\n<link>Jackson County, Missouri</link>\\n<link>Hillsborough County, New Hampshire</link>\\n<link>Seneca County, New York</link>\\n<link>Bennington County, Vermont</link>\\n\\n\\n=== Other variations ===\\n\\n\\n==== <link>Alaska</link> ====\\nAlaska is divided into boroughs rather than counties; the county seat in these case is referred to as the \"borough seat\"; this includes six consolidated city-borough governments (one of which is styled as a \"municipality\"). The <link>Unorganized Borough, Alaska</link>, which covers 49% of the state\\'s area, has no borough government or borough seat. One borough, the Lake and Peninsula Borough, has its borough seat located in another borough, namely King Salmon in Bristol Bay Borough.\\n\\n\\n==== <link>Louisiana</link> ====\\nIn Louisiana, which is divided into parishes rather than counties, county seats are referred to as \"parish seats\".\\n\\n\\n==== <link>New England</link> ====\\nIn New England, counties have served mainly as dividing lines for the states\\' judicial systems. <link>Rhode Island</link> has no county level of government and thus no county seats, and Massachusetts has dissolved many but not all of its county governments. In Vermont, Massachusetts, and <link>Maine</link> county government consists only of a <link>Superior Court</link> and Sheriff (as an <link>officer of the court</link>), both located in a designated \"shire town\". Bennington County, Vermont has two shire towns; the court for \"North Shire\" is in the shire town Manchester, and the Sheriff for the county and court for \"South Shire\" are in the shire town Bennington.\\nIn 2024, <link>Connecticut</link>, which had not defined their counties for anything but statistical, historical and weather warning purposes since 1960, along with ending the use of county seats in particular, will fully transition with the permission of the <link>United States Census Bureau</link> to a system of councils of government for the purposes of boundary definition and as county equivalents.\\n\\n\\n==== <link>South Dakota</link> ====\\nTwo counties in South Dakota, Oglala Lakota and Todd, have their county seat and government services centered in a neighboring county. Their county-level services are provided by Fall River County and Tripp County, respectively.\\n\\n\\n==== <link>Virginia</link> ====\\nIn Virginia, a county seat may be an independent city surrounded by, but not part of, the county of which it is the administrative center; for example, Fairfax City is both the county seat of <link>Fairfax County, Virginia</link> and completely surrounded by Fairfax County, but the city is politically independent of the county. When the county seat is in the independent city, government offices such as the courthouse may be in the independent city under an agreement, such as in Albemarle, or may in be enclaves of the county surrounded by the independent city, such as in Fairfax. Others, such as Prince William, have the courthouse in an enclave surrounded by the independent city and have the county government, the Board of Supervisors, in a different part of the county, far from the county seat. The following counties have their county seat in an independent city:\\n\\nAlbemarle County (Charlottesville)\\nAlleghany County (Covington)\\nAugusta County (Staunton)\\nFairfax County (Fairfax)\\nFrederick County (Winchester)\\nGreensville County (Emporia)\\nHenry County (Martinsville)\\nJames City County (Williamsburg)\\nPrince William County (Manassas)\\nRoanoke County (Salem)\\nRockbridge County (Lexington)\\nRockingham County (Harrisonburg)\\nBedford was an independent city from 1968 to 2013, while also being the county seat of Bedford County. Bedford reverted to an incorporated town, and remains the county seat, though is now part of the county.\\n\\n\\n=== Lists of U.S. county seats by state ===\\nThe state with the most counties is Texas, with 254, and the state with the fewest counties is Delaware, with 3.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nChef-lieu, <link>administrative centre</link>s in <link>Algeria</link>, <link>Belgium</link>, <link>France</link>, <link>Luxembourg</link>, <link>Switzerland</link>, and <link>Tunisia</link>\\n<link>County seat war</link>, disputes between towns in the formation of the United States\\n<link>County town</link>, administrative centres in <link>Ireland</link> and the <link>United Kingdom</link>\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nNational Association of Counties', 'tool_call_id': 'call_etuV7KUORCZcE9qRXZLuNYa5', 'name': 'get_content'}\n",

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world\\'s second-largest country by total area, with the world\\'s longest coastline. Its border with the <link>United States</link> is the world\\'s longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. With a population of over 41 million people, it has widely varying population densities, with the majority residing in urban areas and large areas of the country being sparsely populated. Canada\\'s capital is <link>Ottawa</link> and its three largest metropolitan areas are <link>Toronto</link>, <link>Montreal</link>, and <link>Vancouver</link>.\\nIndigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, <link>France</link> ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal <link>dominion</link> of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories resulting in the displacement of Indigenous populations, and a process of increasing autonomy from the <link>United Kingdom</link>. This increased <link>sovereignty</link> was highlighted by the <link>Statute of Westminster, 1931</link>, and culminated in the <link>Canada Act 1982</link>, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the <link>Parliament of the United Kingdom</link>.\\nCanada is a parliamentary democracy and a <link>constitutional monarchy</link> in the Westminster tradition. The country\\'s <link>head of government</link> is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is appointed by the governor general, representing the <link>monarch</link> of Canada, the ceremonial <link>head of state</link>. The country is a <link>Commonwealth realm</link> and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of <link>government</link> transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and human rights. It is one of the world\\'s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada\\'s long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.\\nA <link>developed country</link>, Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world by nominal GDP, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Recognized as a <link>middle power</link>, Canada\\'s support for <link>multilateralism</link> and internationalism has been closely related to its foreign relations policies of peacekeeping and <link>aid</link> for developing countries. Canada promotes its domestically shared values through participation in multiple international organizations and forums.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\n\\nWhile a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\". In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day <link>Quebec City</link> region used the word to direct French explorer <link>Jacques Cartier</link> to the village of <link>Stadacona</link>. Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to <link>Donnacona</link> (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the <link>Saint Lawrence River</link> as Canada.\\nFrom the 16th to the early 18th century, Canada referred to the part of <link>New France</link> that lay along the Saint Lawrence River. Following the British <link>conquest of New France</link>, this area was known as the British Province of <link>Quebec</link> from 1763 to 1791. In 1791, the area became two British colonies called <link>Upper Canada</link> and <link>Lower Canada</link>. These two colonies were collectively referred to as <link>the Canadas</link> until their union as the <link>Province of Canada</link> in 1841.\\nUpon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country\\'s title. By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"realm of the Commonwealth\".\\nThe Canada Act 1982, which brought the <link>Constitution of Canada</link> fully under Canadian control, referred only to Canada. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to <link>Canada Day</link>.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Indigenous peoples ===\\nThe first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from <link>Siberia</link> by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. The <link>Paleo-Indian</link> archeological sites at <link>Old Crow Flats</link> and <link>Bluefish Caves</link> are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations. Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, <link>Inuit</link>, and Métis, the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and their offspring subsequently developed their own identity.\\nThe Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada\\'s <link>Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</link>. As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent. The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, to which they had no natural immunity, conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations\\' self-sufficiency.\\nAlthough not without conflict, <link>European Canadians</link>\\' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and <link>voyageurs</link> in their explorations of the continent during the <link>North American fur trade</link>. These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties. From the late 18th century, European <link>Canadians</link> forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society. Settler colonialism reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A period of redress began with the formation of a reconciliation commission by the <link>Government of Canada</link> in 2008. This included acknowledgment of cultural genocide, settlement agreements, and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of <link>missing and murdered Indigenous women</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== European colonization ===\\n\\nIt is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer <link>Leif Erikson</link>. In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at <link>L\\'Anse aux Meadows</link> on the northern tip of <link>Newfoundland</link>. No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer <link>John Cabot</link> explored and claimed Canada\\'s Atlantic coast in the name of <link>Henry VII of England</link>. In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the <link>Gulf of Saint Lawrence</link> where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words, \"long live the <link>King</link> of France\", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I. The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast. In general, early settlements during the <link>Age of Discovery</link> appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.\\nIn 1583, Sir <link>Humphrey Gilbert</link>, by the <link>royal prerogative</link> of Queen <link>Elizabeth I</link>, founded St John\\'s, Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp. In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at <link>Tadoussac</link> along the Saint Lawrence. French explorer <link>Samuel de Champlain</link> arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and <link>Acadians</link> settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the <link>Great Lakes</link>, <link>Hudson Bay</link>, and the <link>Mississippi watershed</link> to Louisiana. The <link>Beaver Wars</link> broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.\\nThe English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the <link>Thirteen Colonies</link> to the south. A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the <link>Seven Years\\' War</link>. Mainland <link>Nova Scotia</link> came under British rule with the 1713 <link>Treaty of Utrecht</link> and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years\\' War.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>British North America</link> ===\\n\\nThe <link>Royal Proclamation of 1763</link> established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed <link>Cape Breton Island</link> to Nova Scotia. St John\\'s Island (now <link>Prince Edward Island</link>) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the <link>Quebec Act</link> 1774, expanding Quebec\\'s territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the <link>American Revolution</link>.\\nAfter the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country. The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of <link>Loyalists</link>, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly <link>Atlantic Canada</link>, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. <link>New Brunswick</link> was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in <link>the Maritimes</link>, which led to the incorporation of <link>Saint John, New Brunswick</link>, as Canada\\'s first city. To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in <link>Central Canada</link>, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later <link>Ontario</link>), granting each its own elected <link>legislative</link> assembly.\\n\\nThe Canadas were the main front in the <link>War of 1812</link> between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed. Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850. New arrivals included refugees escaping the <link>Great Irish Famine</link> as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the <link>Highland Clearances</link>. Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.\\nThe desire for <link>responsible government</link> resulted in the abortive <link>Rebellions of 1837</link>. The <link>Durham Report</link> subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of <link>French Canadians</link> into English culture. The <link>Act of Union 1840</link> merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855. The signing of the <link>Oregon Treaty</link> by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the <link>Oregon boundary dispute</link>, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in <link>British Columbia</link> (1858). The Anglo-Russian <link>Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825)</link> established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US <link>Alaska Purchase</link> of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–British Columbia border.\\n\\n\\n=== Confederation and expansion ===\\n\\nFollowing three constitutional conferences, the British North America Act, 1867 officially proclaimed <link>Canadian Confederation</link> on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Canada assumed control of <link>Rupert\\'s Land</link> and the <link>North-Western Territory</link> to form the <link>Northwest Territories</link>, where the Métis\\' grievances ignited the <link>Red River Rebellion</link> and the creation of the province of <link>Manitoba</link> in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873. In 1898, during the <link>Klondike Gold Rush</link> in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the <link>Yukon</link> Territory. <link>Alberta</link> and <link>Saskatchewan</link> became provinces in 1905. Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US.\\nTo open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the <link>Canadian Pacific Railway</link>), passed the <link>Dominion Lands Act</link> to regulate settlement and established the <link>North-West Mounted Police</link> to assert authority over the territory. This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the <link>Canadian Prairies</link> to \"<link>Indian reserve</link>s\", clearing the way for ethnic European <link>block settlement</link>s. This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in <link>western Canada</link> and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land. The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands. The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves. During this time, Canada introduced the <link>Indian Act</link> extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.\\n\\n\\n=== Early 20th century ===\\n\\nBecause Britain still maintained control of Canada\\'s foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War. Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the <link>Canadian Corps</link>, which played a substantial role in the <link>Battle of Vimy Ridge</link> and other major engagements of the war. The <link>Conscription Crisis of 1917</link> erupted when the Unionist Cabinet\\'s proposal to augment the military\\'s dwindling number of active members with <link>conscription</link> was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers. In 1919, Canada joined the <link>League of Nations</link> independently of Britain, and the Statute of Westminster, 1931, affirmed Canada\\'s independence.\\nThe <link>Great Depression in Canada</link> during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country. In response to the downturn, the <link>Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</link> (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a <link>welfare state</link> (as pioneered by <link>Tommy Douglas</link>) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister <link>William Lyon Mackenzie King</link>, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King <link>George VI</link>, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada\\'s independence.\\nThe first <link>Canadian Army</link> units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the <link>Second World War</link>. Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 <link>Dieppe Raid</link>, the <link>Allied invasion of Italy</link>, the <link>Normandy landings</link>, the Battle of Normandy, and the <link>Battle of the Scheldt</link> in 1944. Canada provided asylum for the <link>Dutch monarchy</link> while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from <link>Nazi Germany</link>. Despite another conscription crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.\\n\\n\\n=== Contemporary era ===\\nThe financial crisis of the Great Depression led the <link>Dominion of Newfoundland</link> to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a <link>Crown colony</link> ruled by a British governor. After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.\\nCanada\\'s post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new <link>Canadian identity</link>, marked by the adoption of the <link>maple leaf</link> flag in 1965, the implementation of <link>official bilingualism</link> (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of official <link>multiculturalism</link> in 1971. <link>Socially democratic</link> programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the <link>Canada Pension Plan</link>, and Canada Student Loans; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.\\n\\nFinally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the Canada Act 1982, the <link>patriation</link> of Canada\\'s constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the <link>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</link>. Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own <link>monarchy</link>. In 1999, <link>Nunavut</link> became Canada\\'s third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.\\nAt the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the <link>Quiet Revolution</link> of the 1960s, giving birth to a <link>secular</link> nationalist movement. The radical <link>Front de libération du Québec</link> (FLQ) ignited the <link>October Crisis</link> with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970, and the sovereigntist <link>Parti Québécois</link> was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate <link>Quebec nationalism</link> constitutionally through the <link>Meech Lake Accord</link> failed in 1990. This led to the formation of the <link>Bloc Québécois</link> in Quebec and the invigoration of the <link>Reform Party of Canada</link> in the West. A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent. In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional, and the <link>Clarity Act</link> was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.\\nIn addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of <link>Air <link>India</link> Flight 182</link> in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history; the <link>École Polytechnique massacre</link> in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students; and the <link>Oka Crisis</link> of 1990, the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups. Canada joined the <link>Gulf War</link> in 1990 and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including operations in the <link>Balkans</link> during and after the <link>Yugoslav Wars</link>, and in <link>Somalia</link>, resulting in an incident that has been described as \"the darkest era in the history of the Canadian military\". Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001, resulting in the largest amount of Canadian deaths for any single military mission since the Korean War in the early 1950s.\\nIn 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War and also became involved in battling the <link>Islamic State</link> insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s. The country celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2017; three years later, the <link>COVID-19 pandemic in Canada</link> began on January 27, 2020, causing widespread social and economic disruption. In 2021, an announcement of the discovery of possible gravesites of over 200 Indigenous children found near a former Canadian Indian residential school, which aimed to assimilate Indigenous children for most of the 20th century, refocused media and public attention on the cultural genocide carried out against Canada\\'s Indigenous peoples. A trade war involving the United States, Canada, and <link>Mexico</link> began on February 1, 2025, when U.S. president <link>Donald Trump</link> signed orders imposing tariffs on goods from the two countries entering the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\nBy total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country. By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world\\'s largest area of <link>fresh water</link> lakes. Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 square kilometres (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory. Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world\\'s longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi). In addition to sharing the world\\'s largest land border with the United States—spanning 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi)—Canada shares a land border with <link>Greenland</link> (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on <link>Hans Island</link>, and a <link>maritime boundary</link> with France\\'s <link>overseas collectivity</link> of <link>Saint Pierre and Miquelon</link> to the southeast. Canada is also home to the world\\'s northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole. In latitude, Canada\\'s most northerly point of land is <link>Cape Columbia</link> in Nunavut at 83°6′41″N, with its southern extreme at Middle Island in Lake Erie at 41°40′53″N. In longitude, Canada\\'s land extends from <link>Cape Spear</link>, Newfoundland, at 52°37\\'W, to Mount St. Elias, Yukon Territory, at 141°W.\\nCanada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the <link>Canadian Shield</link>, the <link>interior plains</link>, the <link>Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands</link>, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, <link>Hudson Bay Lowlands</link>, and the <link>Arctic Archipelago</link>. Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northern Arctic regions and through the <link>Rocky Mountains</link>, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture. The Great Lakes feed the <link>St. Lawrence River</link> (in the southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada\\'s economic output. Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of which are larger than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi)—containing much of the world\\'s fresh water. There are also fresh-water glaciers in the <link>Canadian Rockies</link>, the <link>Coast Mountains</link>, and the <link>Arctic Cordillera</link>. Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nAverage winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a <link>continental climate</link>, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe <link>wind chill</link>s. In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).\\nMuch of <link>Northern Canada</link> is covered by ice and <link>permafrost</link>. The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of <link>climate change in Canada</link>. Canada\\'s annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948. The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies. In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in <link>acid rain</link>, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity. Canada is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters globally, with emissions increased by 16.5 percent between 1990 and 2022.\\n\\n\\n=== Biodiversity ===\\n\\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones. These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered. Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries, due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost. About 65 percent of Canada\\'s resident species are considered \"Secure\". Over half of Canada\\'s landscape is intact and relatively free of human development. The <link>boreal forest of Canada</link> is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 square kilometres (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry. Since the end of the last <link>glacial period</link>, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions.\\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation\\'s landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas. Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas. Canada\\'s first National Park, <link>Banff National Park</link> established in 1885 spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi). Canada\\'s oldest provincial park, <link>Algonquin Provincial Park</link>, established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01 sq mi). <link>Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area</link> is the world\\'s largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi). Canada\\'s largest national wildlife region is the <link>Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area</link> which spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45 sq mi).\\n\\n\\n== Government and politics ==\\n\\nCanada is described as a \"full democracy\", with a tradition of <link>liberalism</link>, and an egalitarian, moderate political ideology. An emphasis on <link>social justice</link> has been a distinguishing element of Canada\\'s political culture. <link>Peace, order, and good government</link>, alongside an <link>Implied Bill of Rights</link>, are founding principles of <link>Canadian federalism</link>.\\nAt the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising \"brokerage politics\": the centre-left leaning <link>Liberal Party of Canada</link> and the <link>centre-right</link> leaning <link>Conservative Party of Canada</link> (or its predecessors). The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale. Five parties had representatives elected to Parliament in the 2025 election—the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official Opposition; the Bloc Québécois; the <link>New Democratic Party</link> (occupying the left); and the Green Party. <link>Far-right</link> and <link>far-left</link> politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.\\nCanada has a <link>parliamentary system</link> within the context of a constitutional monarchy—the <link>monarchy of Canada</link> being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and <link>judicial</link> branches. The reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other sovereign Commonwealth countries and Canada\\'s 10 provinces. The monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister, to carry out most of their ceremonial royal duties.\\n\\nThe monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada. However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in rare crisis situations, the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative) is otherwise directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of <link>the Crown</link> responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister, the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House. The Prime Minister\\'s Office (PMO) is one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.\\n\\nThe <link>Parliament of Canada</link> passes all federal statute laws. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the Senate. While Canada inherited the British concept of <link>parliamentary supremacy</link>, this was later, with the enactment of the <link>Constitution Act, 1982</link>, all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law.\\nEach of the 343 members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The Constitution Act, 1982, requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the <link>Canada Elections Act</link> limits this to four years with a \"fixed\" election date in October; general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost <link>confidence vote</link> in the House. The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.\\nCanadian <link>federalism</link> divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are <link>unicameral</link> and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada\\'s three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign, have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces, and differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.\\n\\n\\n=== Law ===\\n\\nThe Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions. The <link>Constitution Act, 1867</link> (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments. The Statute of Westminster, 1931, granted full autonomy, and the Constitution Act, 1982, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be overridden by any government; a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years.\\n\\nCanada\\'s judiciary interprets laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The <link>Supreme Court of Canada</link> is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since 2017 by Richard Wagner, the <link>Chief Justice of Canada</link>. The governor general appoints the court\\'s nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice. The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.\\nCommon law prevails everywhere except Quebec, where civil law predominates. Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces. In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal <link>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</link>.\\n<link>Canadian Aboriginal law</link> provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada. Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples. The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by <link>section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982</link>. These rights may include provision of services, such as healthcare through the <link>Indian Health Transfer Policy</link>, and exemption from taxation.\\n\\n\\n=== Provinces and territories ===\\n\\nCanada is a federation composed of 10 <link>federated states</link>, called provinces, and three <link>federal territories</link>. These may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and social programs, as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Although the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, <link>equalization payments</link> are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.\\nThe major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown and power and authority from the Constitution Act, 1867, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council, rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the Constitution Act, 1867, are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment, while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.\\n\\n\\n=== Foreign relations ===\\n\\nCanada is recognized as a middle power for its role in global affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions. Canada is known for its commitment to international peace and security, as well as being a mediator in conflicts, and for providing aid to developing countries.\\nCanada and the United States have a long and complex relationship; historically close allies, they co-operate regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts. Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France, along with both countries\\' former colonies through its membership in the <link>Commonwealth of Nations</link> and the <link>Organisation internationale de la Francophonie</link>. Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during the Second World War. Canada has diplomatic and consular offices in over 270 locations in approximately 180 foreign countries.\\nCanada promotes its domestically shared values through participating in  multiple international organizations. Canada was a founding member of the United Nations (UN) in 1945 and formed the <link>North American Aerospace Defense Command</link> together with the United States in 1958. The country has membership in the <link>World Trade Organization</link>, the <link>Five Eyes</link>, the <link>G7</link> and the <link>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</link> (OECD). The country was a founding member the <link>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</link> forum (APEC) in 1989 and joined the <link>Organization of American States</link> (OAS) in 1990. Canada ratified the <link>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</link> (UDHR) in 1948, and seven principal UN human rights conventions and covenants since then.\\n\\n\\n=== Military and peacekeeping ===\\n\\nAlongside many domestic obligations, more than 3,000 <link>Canadian Armed Forces</link> (CAF) personnel are deployed in multiple foreign military operations. The Canadian unified forces comprise the <link>Royal Canadian Navy</link>, Canadian Army, and <link>Royal Canadian Air Force</link>. The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\"—with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 <link>Canadian Rangers</link>. In 2022, Canada\\'s military expenditure totalled approximately $26.9 billion, or around 1.2 percent of the country\\'s <link>gross domestic product</link> (GDP) – placing it 14th for military expenditure by country.\\nCanada\\'s role in developing peacekeeping and its participation in major peacekeeping initiatives during the 20th century has played a major role in its positive global image. Peacekeeping is deeply embedded in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy apart from the United States. Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the United Nations, such as the Vietnam War or the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Since the 21st century, Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts has greatly declined. The large decrease was a result of Canada directing its participation to UN-sanctioned military operations through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, rather than directly through the UN. The change to participation via <link>NATO</link> has resulted in a shift towards more militarized and deadly missions rather than traditional peacekeeping duties.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\nCanada has a highly developed <link>mixed-market</link> economy, with the world\\'s ninth-largest nominal GDP as of 2023, at approximately US$2.221 trillion. It is one of the world\\'s largest <link>trading nation</link>s, with a highly <link>globalized</link> economy. In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion. Canada\\'s exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States. In 2018, Canada had a <link>trade deficit</link> in goods of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion. The <link>Toronto Stock Exchange</link> is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by <link>market capitalization</link>, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion.\\nThe <link>Bank of Canada</link> is the <link>central bank</link> of the country. The minister of finance and minister of innovation, science, and industry use data from <link>Statistics Canada</link> to enable financial planning and develop economic policy. Canada has a strong <link>cooperative banking</link> sector, with the world\\'s highest per-capita membership in <link>credit union</link>s. It ranks low in the <link>Corruption Perceptions Index</link> (14th in 2023) and \"is widely regarded as among the least corrupt countries of the world\". It ranks high in the <link>Global Competitiveness Report</link> (19th in 2024). Canada\\'s economy ranks above most <link>Western nations</link> on <link>the Heritage Foundation</link>\\'s <link>Index of Economic Freedom</link> and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity. The country\\'s average household <link>disposable income</link> per capita is \"well above\" the <link>OECD</link> average. Canada ranks among the lowest of the most <link>developed countries</link> for housing affordability and <link>foreign direct investment</link>.\\nSince the early 20th century, the growth of Canada\\'s manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one. The Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country\\'s workforce. Canada has an unusually important primary sector, of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent components. Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby mines or sources of timber. \\n\\nCanada\\'s economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since the Second World War. The <link>Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement</link> (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the <link>North American Free Trade Agreement</link> (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994 (later replaced by the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement). As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade agreements with 51 different countries.\\nCanada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world. The vast <link>Athabasca oil sands</link> and other oil reserves give Canada 13 percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world\\'s third- or fourth-largest. Canada is additionally one of the world\\'s largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, <link>canola</link>, and other grains. Canada\\'s main exports are zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, <link>molybdenum</link>, cobalt, and cadmium. Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and <link>aeronautics</link> representing particularly important industries. The country\\'s fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy.\\n\\n\\n=== Science and technology ===\\n\\nIn 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9 billion on domestic <link>research and development</link>, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion. As of 2023, the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine. The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in <link>scientific journals</link>, according to the <link>Nature Index</link>, and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms. Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population.\\n\\nCanada\\'s achievements in science and technology include the creation of the modern <link>alkaline battery</link>, the discovery of <link>insulin</link>, the development of the <link>polio vaccine</link>, and discoveries about the interior structure of the <link>atomic nucleus</link>. Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the <link>artificial cardiac pacemaker</link>, mapping the <link>visual cortex</link>, the development of the <link>electron microscope</link>, <link>plate tectonics</link>, <link>deep learning</link>, <link>multi-touch</link> technology, and the identification of the first <link>black hole</link>, <link>Cygnus X-1</link>. Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include <link>stem cell</link>s, <link>site-directed mutagenesis</link>, <link>T-cell receptor</link>, and the identification of the genes that cause <link>Fanconi anemia</link>, <link>cystic fibrosis</link>, and <link>early-onset Alzheimer\\'s disease</link>, among numerous other diseases.\\nThe <link>Canadian Space Agency</link> runs an active space program focused on deep-space, planetary, and aviation research, along with rockets and satellites. Canada launched its first satellite, <link>Alouette 1</link>, in 1962. It contributes to the <link>International Space Station</link> and is known for its robotic tools, such as multiple <link>Canadarm</link>s. Canada has initiated many long-term projects, including the <link>Radarsat</link> satellite series and the Black Brant rocket series.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nThe <link>2021 Canadian census</link> enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure. It is estimated that Canada\\'s population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023. The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth. Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world, driven mainly by economic policy and family reunification. A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted in 2021. Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 47,600 in 2022. New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\\nCanada\\'s population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world, with approximately 95 percent of the population residing south of the <link>55th parallel north</link>. About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the border with the contiguous United States. Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living in urban centres. The majority of Canadians (over 70 percent ) live below the 49th parallel, with 50 percent of Canadians living south of 45°42′ (45.7 degrees) north. The most densely populated part of the country is the <link>Quebec City–Windsor Corridor</link> in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.\\nThe majority of Canadians (81.1 percent) live in family households, 12.1 percent report living alone, and 6.8 percent live with other relatives or unrelated persons. Fifty-one percent of households are couples with or without children, 8.7 percent are single-parent households, 2.9 percent are multigenerational households, and 29.3 percent are single-person households.\\n\\n\\n=== Ethnicity ===\\n\\nRespondents in the 2021 Canadian census self-reported over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\". The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5 percent), North American (22.9 percent), Asian (19.3 percent), North American Indigenous (6.1 percent), African (3.8 percent), <link>Latin</link>, Central and South American (2.5 percent), Caribbean (2.1 percent), Oceanian (0.3 percent), and other (6 percent). Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent.\\n\\nThe country\\'s ten largest self-reported ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent).\\nOf the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021, approximately 24.5 million reported being \"White\", representing 67.4 percent of the population. The Indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million people, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021. One out of every four Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous <link>visible minority</link>, the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1 percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7 percent), Black (1.5 million; 4.3 percent), Filipinos (960,000  2.6 percent), Arabs (690,000; 1.9 percent), Latin Americans (580,000; 1.6 percent), Southeast Asians (390,000; 1.1 percent), West Asians (360,000; 1.0 percent), Koreans (220,000; 0.6 percent) and Japanese (99,000; 0.3 percent).\\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent. In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada\\'s population, were members of visible minority groups. The 2021 census indicated that 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0 percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent. In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada.\\n\\n\\n=== Languages ===\\n\\nA multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the <link>official language</link>s) being the mother tongues of approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively. Canada\\'s official bilingualism policies give citizens the right to receive federal government services in either English or French with official-language minorities guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.\\nQuebec\\'s 1974 Official Language Act established French as the only official language of the province. Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial <link>Francophone</link> populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba, with Ontario having the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec. New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has an <link>Acadian French</link> minority constituting 33 percent of the population. There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island.\\nOther provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official. There are 11 Indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects. Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories. <link>Inuktitut</link> is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory.\\nAs of the 2021 census, just over 7.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their <link>first language</link>. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), <link>Cantonese</link> (553,380), Spanish (538,870), <link>Arabic</link> (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890). The country is also home to many <link>sign language</link>s, some of which are Indigenous. <link>American Sign Language</link> (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools. <link>Quebec Sign Language</link> (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nCanada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs. The Constitution of Canada refers to God; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to <link>religious pluralism</link>. <link>Freedom of religion in Canada</link> is a constitutionally protected right.\\nRates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, they still believe in God. The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter.\\nAccording to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest <link>religion in Canada</link>, with <link>Roman Catholic</link>s representing 29.9 percent of the population having the most adherents. <link>Christians</link> overall representing 53.3 percent of the population, are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6 percent. Other faiths include Islam (4.9 percent), Hinduism (2.3 percent), Sikhism (2.1 percent), Buddhism (1.0 percent), Judaism (0.9 percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2 percent). Canada has the second-largest national Sikh population, behind India.\\n\\n\\n== Health ==\\n\\n<link>Healthcare in Canada</link> is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of <link>publicly funded health care</link>, informally called Medicare. It is guided by the provisions of the <link>Canada Health Act</link> of 1984 and is universal. Universal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country\". Around 30 percent of Canadians\\' healthcare is paid for through the private sector. This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as <link>prescription drug</link>s, <link>dentistry</link> and <link>optometry</link>. Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs.\\n\\nIn common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years. Life expectancy is 81.1 years. A 2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88 percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they \"had good or very good health\". Eighty percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use. Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among OECD countries, contributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of <link>diabetes</link>. Four chronic diseases—cancer (leading cause of death), <link>cardiovascular diseases</link>, <link>respiratory diseases</link>, and diabetes—account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada. There are approximately 8 million people aged 15 and older with one or more disabilities in Canada.\\nIn 2021, the <link>Canadian Institute for Health Information</link> reported that healthcare spending reached $308 billion, or 12.7 percent of Canada\\'s GDP for that year. In 2022, Canada\\'s per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the OECD. Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources. The <link>Commonwealth Fund</link>\\'s 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last. Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage. An increasing problem in Canada\\'s health system is a lack of healthcare professionals, and hospital capacity.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n\\n<link>Education in Canada</link> is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and <link>local government</link>s. Education is within provincial jurisdiction and a province\\'s curriculum is overseen by its government. Education in Canada is generally divided into <link>primary education</link>, followed by secondary and post-secondary education. Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada. Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded. Established in 1663, <link>Université Laval</link> is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada. The nation\\'s three top ranking universities are the <link>University of Toronto</link>, McGill, and the <link>University of British Columbia</link>. The largest university is the University of Toronto, which has over 85,000 students.\\nAccording to a 2022 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world; the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having <link>tertiary education</link>, with over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree. Canada spends an average of 5.3 percent of its GDP on education. The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student). As of 2022, 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.\\nThe mandatory education age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years, contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent. Just over 60,000 children are homeschooled in the country as of 2016. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, with the average student scoring 523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493 in 2015.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\nHistorically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions. During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.\\nCanada\\'s culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a <link>just society</link> are constitutionally protected. Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized human rights and inclusiveness for all its people. The official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada\\'s significant accomplishments and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture. As a whole, Canada is in theory a <link>cultural mosaic</link> of regional ethnic subcultures.\\nCanada\\'s approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, <link>social integration</link>, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, a <link>social liberal</link> attitude toward women\\'s rights (like pregnancy termination) and LGBT rights, and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada\\'s political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country\\'s foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the national park system, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\\n\\n\\n=== Symbols ===\\n\\nThemes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism. Modern symbols emphasize the country\\'s geography, cold climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols. The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada\\'s current and previous flags and on the <link>Arms of Canada</link>. Canada\\'s official tartan, known as the \"maple leaf tartan\", reflects the colours of the maple leaf through the seasons—green in the spring, gold in the early <link>autumn</link>, red at the first <link>frost</link>, and brown after falling. The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.\\nOther prominent symbols include the national motto, \"<link>A mari usque ad mare</link>\" (\"From Sea to Sea\"), the sports of <link>ice hockey</link> and <link>lacrosse</link>, the <link>beaver</link>, <link>Canada goose</link>, <link>common loon</link>, <link>Canadian horse</link>, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies, and, more recently, the <link>totem pole</link> and <link>Inuksuk</link>. <link>Canadian beer</link>, <link>maple syrup</link>, <link>tuque</link>s, <link>canoes</link>, <link>nanaimo bar</link>s, <link>butter tart</link>s, and <link>poutine</link> are defined as uniquely Canadian. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, and the beaver on the nickel. An image of the monarch appears on $20 bank notes and the obverse of coins.\\n\\n\\n=== Literature ===\\n\\n<link>Canadian literature</link> is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration. This progressed into three major themes of historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada\\'s position within the world, all of which tie into the <link>garrison mentality</link>. In recent decades, Canada\\'s literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from around the world. By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world\\'s best.\\nNumerous Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards, including novelist, poet, and literary critic <link>Margaret Atwood</link>, who received two <link>Booker Prize</link>s; <link>Alice Munro</link>, who received a <link>Nobel Prize in Literature</link>; and Booker Prize recipient <link>Michael Ondaatje</link>, who wrote the novel <link>The English Patient</link>, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the <link>Academy Award for Best Picture</link>. <link>L. M. Montgomery</link> produced a series of children\\'s novels beginning in 1908 with <link>Anne of Green Gables</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== Media ===\\n\\nCanada\\'s media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized. The Broadcasting Act declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada\". Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the <link>Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</link> (CBC), the <link>National Film Board of Canada</link> (NFB), and the <link>Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission</link> (CRTC).\\nCanadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a \"handful of corporations\". The largest of these corporations is the country\\'s national <link>public broadcaster</link>, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French. In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as <link>TVOntario</link> and <link>Télé-Québec</link>.\\nNon-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, <link>Australia</link>, and France. In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing. Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.\\n\\n\\n=== Visual arts ===\\n\\nArt in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by Indigenous peoples, and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism. The nature of <link>Canadian art</link> reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.\\nModern painting in Canada has been greatly influenced by several major movements that have emerged over the years. One of the most prominent movements is the Group of Seven, which was founded in 1920, aimed to capture the wilderness in their artwork.  Associated with the group was  <link>Emily Carr</link>, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the <link>Indigenous peoples of the <link>Pacific Northwest</link> Coast</link>. The mid-20th century saw the rise of <link>abstract art</link> in Canada, with artists like <link>Jean-Paul Riopelle</link> and <link>Paul-Émile Borduas</link>. The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of <link>conceptual art</link>, with artists such as <link>Michael Snow</link> and <link>Ian Carr-Harris</link>. This era also saw the emergence of Indigenous artists like <link>Norval Morrisseau</link>, who combined traditional Indigenous techniques with modern art styles. In more recent years, <link>contemporary art</link> has seen a revival of <link>figurative art</link>, with artists such as <link>Kent Monkman</link> and <link>Shuvinai Ashoona</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nCanadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes. Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes <link>church hall</link>s, chamber halls, conservatories, <link>academies</link>, performing arts centres, record companies, <link>radio stations</link>, and television <link>music video</link> channels. Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music. As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world, producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles. Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC. The <link>Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences</link> presents Canada\\'s music industry awards, the <link>Juno Award</link>s. The <link>Canadian Music Hall of Fame</link> honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.\\nPatriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years. The earliest work of patriotic music in Canada, \"<link>The Bold Canadian</link>\", was written in 1812. \"<link>The Maple Leaf Forever</link>\", written in 1866, was a popular patriotic song throughout <link>English Canada</link> and, for many years, served as an unofficial national anthem. \"<link>O Canada</link>\" also served as an unofficial national anthem for much of the 20th century and was adopted as the country\\'s official anthem in 1980.\\n\\n\\n=== Sports ===\\n\\nCanada\\'s official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse. Other major professional games include <link>curling</link>, basketball, baseball, soccer, and football. Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by numerous \"Halls of Fame\" and museums, such as <link>Canada\\'s Sports Hall of Fame</link>.\\nCanada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States. Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the <link>National Hockey League</link>, three Major League Soccer teams, and one team in each of <link>Major League Baseball</link> and the <link>National Basketball Association</link>. Other popular professional competitions include the <link>Canadian Football League</link>, <link>National Lacrosse League</link>, the <link>Canadian Premier League</link>, and the curling tournaments hosted by <link>Curling Canada</link>. Canadians identified hockey as their preferred sport for viewing, followed by soccer and then basketball.\\nIn terms of participation, <link>swimming</link> was the most commonly reported sport by over one-third (35 percent) of Canadians in 2023. This was closely followed by <link>cycling</link> (33 percent) and <link>running</link> (27 percent). The popularity of specific sports varies; in general, the Canadian-born population was more likely to have participated in <link>winter sports</link> such as ice hockey (the most popular young adult team sport),  skating, <link>skiing</link> and <link>snowboarding</link>, compared with immigrants, who were more likely to have played soccer (the most popular youth team sport), <link>tennis</link> or basketball. Sports such as <link>golf</link>, volleyball, <link>badminton</link>, <link>bowling</link>, and <link>martial arts</link> are also widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.\\nCanada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics—particularly the Winter Games as a \"winter sports nation\"—and has hosted high-profile international sporting events such as the <link>1976 Summer Olympics</link>, the <link>1988 Winter Olympics</link>, the <link>2010 Winter Olympics</link>, the <link>2015 FIFA Women\\'s World Cup</link>, the <link>2015 Pan American Games</link> and <link>2015 Parapan American Games</link>. The country is scheduled to co-host the <link>2026 FIFA World Cup</link> alongside Mexico and the United States.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n<link>Index of Canada-related articles</link>\\n<link>List of Canada-related topics by provinces and territories</link>\\n<link>Outline of Canada</link>\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n This article incorporates content that is under an open licence from Statistics Canada - (FAQ).\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOverviews\\n\\nCanada from UCB Libraries GovPubs\\nCanada profile from the OECD\\nKey Development Forecasts for Canada from <link>International Futures</link>\\nGovernment\\n\\nOfficial website of the Government of Canada\\nOfficial website of the <link>Governor General of Canada</link>\\nOfficial website of the Prime Ministers of Canada\\nTravel\\n\\nCanada\\'s official website for travel and tourism', 'tool_call_id': 'call_rGP8xfUDopikLgWZyk4DOyJx', 'name': 'get_content'}\n",

    "You may have observed that while our initial implementation of `WikiAgent` succeeds at these relatively challenging games, if we increase the difficulty slightly, then the agent will fail (one possible example is the game: Joinery → Amethyst; our agent will usually fail on this task). However, this doesn't mean that GPT-4o-mini does not have the capability to perform better on this task, but this capability might be blocked because we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompted the model poorly or ineffectively.\n",
    "- Stored and presented the task history poorly.\n",
    "- Didn't give the model sufficient tools to accomplish the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is hard to show that a model does not have a certain capability, even if we've failed to *demonstrate* this capability. For example, it took 3.5 years after the release of GPT-2 (and 2.5 years after the release of GPT-3) for people to discover that [chain-of-thought reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) massively improves model performance, which enabled the same models to complete significantly harder tasks. Dangerous capability evaluations for LLM agents require us to elicit the best capabilities possible, until we feel we've managed to gain [**evidence of absence**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence), **not** just **absence of evidence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, there are two categories of elicitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Narrow elicitation**: Task-specific methods that improve model performance on a particular task or small class of tasks, but likely won't impact model performance in general across many tasks. \n",
    "    - E.g. A tool that gives the model access to the content of arbitrary wikipedia articles. This will improve performance on this task significantly, but wouldn't generalize to other tasks.\n",
    "2. **General elicitation**: Task-agnostic methods that improve model performance on a wide array of possible tasks. \n",
    "    - E.g. Chain-of-thought prompting: This tends to improve model performance on a wide array of tasks. These sorts of elicitation methods are the ones we're most interested in. If researchers find an improvement to models that is roughly as easy and effective as chain-of-thought prompting, then we would see a very rapid increase in risk from AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The elicitation methods we'll try in this section will mostly revolve around prompting in order to obtain better performance, including chain-of-thought prompting, the ReAct Framework; as well as some more exotic methods, like a lookahead tool.\n",

    "<details><summary>Tip - How to find wikipedia pages to test on</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "You might start having a hard time coming up with wikipedia pages to test on. Luckily, there are websites which generate random pages for this purpose, one good website is accessible via: https://wikispeedruns.com/ (you may want to change the \"Random Article Generator Settings\" to sample from the most popular 100,000 wikipedia pages, as the default setting of 3000 will generally generate paths that are too easy to test our agent). We've also provided you with a list of 18 wikipedia pairs, stored as `wiki_pairs`. These are ordered approximately in increasing difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether two pages are connected via links, use this free online tool to see the possible paths between pages: https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/ (be somewhat careful with this though, as the paths that this website believes are accessible may not be accessible to our agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll use the `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` model to gauge whether our elicitation methods are effective since OpenAI will occasionally release small updates to `gpt-4o-mini` which change its behaviour. However, if you're curious, you can try testing your elicitation methods on the newest `gpt-4o-mini` model. What you will most likely notice is that your elicitation methods improve the model significantly less, and the model performs much better at the task without needing as much elicitation. This is because their most recent models are generally more capable, and so saturate the evaluation of \"How well can a model play the Wikipedia game.\" For a real agent evaluation, you'd want to have increasingly difficult tasks, so that even as models improve, we can find tasks that are too difficult for them to achieve (e.g. the 16-hour tasks on METR's [Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/))"

    "The [**ReAct** framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) is an extension of chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead of prompting the model to think step-by-step, it separates this into two steps, especially designed for agent-based tasks:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that during the reasoning step, when you're calling the model without tools, OpenAI won't provide the model with a description of the tools. However, we definitely want the model to have information about the available tools when it's reasoning about what actions to take. So, we'll have to ensure that the tool descriptions are in the `system_instruction` we provide. (This will lead to some redundancy when the model takes an action, but redundancy is usually alright with LLMs). This means that from now on we will have to pass the list of tools to both the *task* and the *agent*."

      "   - The **\"Byzantine Empire\"** link could lead me to developments in communication or administrative technologies that later influenced European web technology.\n",
      "   - The **\"Migration Period\"** and **\"Middle Ages\"** links discuss changes in communication and political structures in Europe, which could eventually relate to technological advancement.\n",
      "   - The **\"Eastern Orthodox Church\"** might provide connections to the spread of information in Eastern Europe, which could, in a broader sense, connect to later developments in internet technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Broader Technology Links**: There are no direct links to technology or computing in the content, so I would need to take a more roundabout route.

      "1. **Current Impasse**: I have hit a wall with the available links, and none have successfully directed me to articles that could connect to the Free Thai Movement.\n",

      "### Current Situation Overview:\n",
      "1. **Repeated Navigation Failures**: All major links derived from the original page have resulted in invalid paths.\n",
      "2. **Insufficient Content Connections**: The historical context, potential alumni, and governance themes have not yielded any fruitful leads toward the Free Thai Movement.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Consider Broad Historical Keywords**:\n",
      "   - Look for pages that discuss \"Thai history during World War II.\"\n",
      "   - Seek for \"Resistance movements in Japan-occupied territories\" that may discuss the Free Thai Movement as part of the larger picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Explore General War History Pages**:\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Utilize Related Cultural or Political Movements**:\n",

      "\n",
      "Model response ('Action'): Since I do not have access to make searches directly in external resources or a search engine to find \"World War II in Asia\" or \"Thailand during World War II,\" my only way forward is to navigate through the current content again for mention of Thailand, World War II, or any relevant historical connections. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I have already retrieved the content of the Blavatnik School of Government multiple times, and thus repeated attempts to analyze the content have not yielded new links. Given this, it appears I have no valid link options that may lead me to the Free Thai Movement directly from here.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this stage, I am left with the option to conclude that I should attempt to access information beyond the current Wikipedia context, as I cannot find the Free Thai Movement using the links available through the methodology tied to the current content.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Approach\n",
      "Since all avenues from the Blavatnik page have been exhausted without valid options to move forward, I have reached an impasse in navigating Wikipedia effectively toward the Free Thai Movement. Therefore, a summary of the path taken and the complete lack of avenues to the desired article is noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, I recommend that I stop trying to navigate Wikipedia directly anymore and accept that I won't be able to reach the \"Free Thai Movement\" article on this attempt through the current content. \n",
      "\n",
      "If further exploration is desired, I would need to start a new session focusing perhaps on different initial content that may lead more directly to the Free Thai Movement, or lean on other academic or reliable online resources outside of this interaction. \n",

      "### Summary of the Situation\n",
      "1. **Repeated Attempts**: Multiple attempts to access specific links have resulted in invalid paths.\n",
      "2. **Content Limitation**: The content available does not appear to contain references directly relevant to the Free Thai Movement or suitable intermediary topics that could bridge the gap to this subject.\n",
      "3. **Persistence and Alertness**: While I have looked through historical mentions and the current themes of governance and international relations, no solid connections to the desired movement have presented themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strategy for Next Steps\n",
      "1. **Broaden Context**: Instead of just focusing on specific links, I will consider:\n",
      "   - General themes about **Southeast Asia during World War II**, resistance movements, and governance during crises.\n",
      "   - Possible links from notable figures or entities related to armed resistance against Japanese occupation that might exist within the large scope of academic or historical discourse in the current content.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Look for Specific Keywords**: Identify any significant historical mentions relating to Thailand or anti-Japanese resistance movements. This process involves skimming the previously retrieved page content one last time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Direct Pathway Issues**: Accept that my current browsing point has limits and may not yield direct results. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Executing the Final Approach\n",
      "I will methodically analyze the main content for any keywords, themes, or generalized topics that may reference Thailand's involvement during World War II or discussions of resistance. If any significant figures, events, or terms are mentioned, I can focus on those as potential keywords for future searches or reference points.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, while I can't directly create a new page or search route, I can analyze what has been provided in the current content for any final missed connections to formally explore. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will now conduct one more careful review of the **entire Blavatnik School of Government content**, watching specifically for any hooks that could conceptually align with my goal of reaching the Free Thai Movement. If I still find nothing relevant, I will conclude that there simply are no pathways to navigate from this page at this moment.\n",

      "USER: Now, what action will you take based on your reasoning?\n",
      "\n",
      "Model response ('Action'): Since I cannot directly analyze the content again in a new manner from the previous retrievals, and the repeated navigation efforts have been exhausted without any fruitful results, I will take a moment to summarize the journey and clarify my conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Content Review**: I have thoroughly accessed the Blavatnik School of Government page several times, attempting to trace paths to related subjects.\n",
      "2. **Invalid Links**: All attempts to follow linked terms have resulted in failures, indicating that those pathways are not available to connect to the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "3. **Historical Context Limitation**: The lack of references in the current content to World War II, Southeast Asia, or the Free Thai Movement clearly indicates that this page does not facilitate access to those topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion of Current Session\n",
      "In summary, I am unable to find a valid route to the Free Thai Movement from the Blavatnik School of Government page I originally landed on. Therefore, I must accept that there are no accessible pathways within this content to reach the desired topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going forward:\n",
      "- **If Needed Next Steps**: If further exploration for the Free Thai Movement is desired, I would recommend starting from different topics or pages that are historically aligned with the timeframe and context of the movement, ideally focusing on World War II in the Southeast Asian region.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, I will conclude this session, as I have reached an impasse without successful avenues toward my objective.\n",
      "\n",
      "USER: Think carefully about your current situation and what actions you want to take to get closer to Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model response ('Reason'): Recognizing that I have not successfully navigated to the page on the Free Thai Movement after numerous attempts and repeated analysis of the Blavatnik School of Government page, it's essential to reconsider my approach to achieve my goal.\n",

      "### Current Understanding\n",
      "- **Impass**: I cannot find valid links from the current page that connect to the Free Thai Movement. Previous attempts to follow links were unsuccessful.\n",
      "- **Potential Overlooked Paths**: I need to reassess if there are any references or mention of significant terms related to Thailand, World War II, or resistance movements that I may have previously missed.\n",
      "- **Broadening the Scope**: If I cannot connect directly, I should see if there are broader themes in conflicts or historical governance that could encompass discussions about the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### New Steps to Take\n",
      "1. **Scan for Keywords**: Carefully look for keywords related to Thailand, World War II, or resistance movements, especially in the academic or historical context provided by the Blavatnik School of Government.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Explore General Themes**: Look for links to broader categories or histories that may mention the Thai context or resistance movements against the Japanese occupation during the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Extend Beyond Current Page**: If there are still no successful links, I will acknowledge that the current content does not permit further navigation toward the Free Thai Movement. I can conclude that a more general approach to Wikipedia or academic databases is needed to find related information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Last Opportunities**: Review the **Oxford Institute for Law, Ethics and Armed Conflict (ELAC)** one last time since it deals with armed conflicts. If that connection is valid, it may have some reference to Japan-occupied Thailand.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Action Now\n",
      "1. I will attempt to look closely at any historical implications of the **Oxford Institute for Law, Ethics and Armed Conflict (ELAC)** and if it discusses warfare during World War II concerning Southeast Asia or notably Thailand. \n",
      "2. I will then take action to attempt to navigate to ELAC or any similarly described page to make a final push toward my goal. \n",

      "### New Strategic Approaches\n",
      "To move forward effectively, here are several alternative strategies I can consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Historical Search**: Look for broader historical contexts on Wikipedia itself outside of the current page. For instance, searching directly for \"Thailand during World War II\" or \"Southeast Asia resistance movements\" could yield better results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **General Wikipedia Navigation**: Navigate from the Wikipedia homepage or 'History' categories to find relevant pages related to the Free Thai Movement without relying on the initial content.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Returning to Broader Themes**: Focus on terms directly related to resistance during World War II, which might relate to the Free Thai Movement and allow exploration of associated pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Concluding Current Attempts**: If these avenues yield nothing, I may need to conclude this session positively while acknowledging the limitations and consider that alternative sources or sessions may help facilitate this research problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Actions\n",
      "As my current paths through direct navigation from the Blavatnik School of Government have failed, I can either:\n",
      "1. Try to initiate a search for common historical events concerning the Free Thai Movement directly.\n",
      "2. Accept the current limitations of the page I am on and summarize my search methodologies and outcomes thus far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given my understanding of the need to explore further historical topics, I will make a strategic decision to **navigate away from the current page and seek a more relevant historical context directly by potentially searching for broader subjects like \"Thailand during World War II.\"** \n",

      "### Final Summary of Actions:\n",
      "1. **Repeated Attempts**: I have attempted to navigate several times, focusing on relevant links from the content of the Blavatnik School of Government page.\n",
      "2. **Invalid Links**: All link attempts have resulted in failures, demonstrating that I cannot access relevant content connected to the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "3. **Lack of Historical Context**: The current content does not adequately cover historical themes or references related to the Free Thai Movement or World War II in Thailand.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Given the accumulated findings and the inability to find valid pathways to the Free Thai Movement, I conclude that it would be best to stop navigating this page. I recognize that pursuing information on the Free Thai Movement may require starting from different subjects or more relevant pages that discuss historical resistance movements in Southeast Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Action:\n",
      "I will **end this session** while affirmatively recognizing that future efforts should focus on exploring Wikipedia's historical sections directly related to World War II, Southeast Asia, or resistance movements for more effective results. \n",
      "\n",
      "This concludes my approach from the Blavatnik School of Government without reaching the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "USER: Think carefully about your current situation and what actions you want to take to get closer to Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model response ('Reason'): After thoroughly considering my previous attempts to navigate from the Blavatnik School of Government page to the Free Thai Movement, I recognize that all efforts to access valid links have been unsuccessful. Here's a detailed breakdown and a reevaluation of my approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Current Situation:**\n",
      "1. **Navigated Links Failures:** All attempts to follow links from the content have led to invalid pages.\n",
      "2. **No Relevant Pathways:** The original content of the Blavatnik School of Government has not provided references or themes directly aligned with the Free Thai Movement or its historical context.\n",
      "3. **Exhausted Non-Results:** I've repeatedly searched key connections and themes, ultimately hitting a dead end in terms of accessing meaningful content related to resistance movements in World War II.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reflecting on Next Steps\n",
      "Given this situation, I have come to a few important conclusions and potential actions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Final Review of Terms:**\n",
      "   - I will re-evaluate if there are any specific terms or keywords in the current content that have been overlooked which relate even indirectly to the Free Thai Movement, such as mentions of Thailand, resistance, or military operations during World War II.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Investigate Historical Linkages:**\n",
      "   - Look for mentions of broader historical concepts related to global or Southeast Asian history. This may involve looking for connections to governmental policies during wartime or resistance movements that occurred in that era.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Direct Navigation Away from Current Page:**\n",
      "   - If I come to realize that I cannot access pages relevant to the Free Thai Movement, I can accept that I need to start a new search independently or explore different sections of Wikipedia that are specifically focused on World War II or Southeast Asian history.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consolidate Findings for Future Reference:**\n",
      "   - I will summarize my search efforts in terms of what has been found versus what hasn’t to help guide future research or inquiries about the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Immediate Action\n",
      "I will analyze the content once more, focusing specifically on keywords related to Thailand, World War II, or any broader historical narratives that may suggest a pathway toward the Free Thai Movement. This is a final evaluation before concluding that this page does not lead to my target.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will now proceed with this focused survey of the text for relevant terms that may have previously been missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "USER: Now, what action will you take based on your reasoning?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant: \n",
      "None\n",
      "\n",
      "TOOL CALL: \n",
      "Tool = get_content, Args = {} \n",
      "TOOL RESPONSE:\n",
      " The Blavatnik School of Government is the school of public policy of the <link>University of Oxford</link> in <link>Oxford</link>, <link>England</link>. The School was founded in 2010 following a £75 million donation from business magnate <link>Len Blavatnik</link>, supported by £26 million from the\n",
      "\n",
      "USER: \n",
      "What's your next step to reach Free Thai Movement? Make sure to think carefully about what steps you should take to get there.\n",
      "\n",
      "USER: Think carefully about your current situation and what actions you want to take to get closer to Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model response ('Reason'): Reflecting on the situation, I've attempted to navigate from the Blavatnik School of Government page to the Free Thai Movement multiple times without success. All available links have led to invalid pages, and the content has not provided any relevant connections to the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this context, I’ll lay out a structured course of action regarding what my next steps should be to effectively reach the desired information:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Current Analysis\n",
      "1. **Continuous Invalid Paths**: Attempts to follow links available in the current content have repeatedly resulted in failures.\n",
      "2. **Historical Relevance**: No mention of the Free Thai Movement, World War II, or related context has emerged from the content accessed.\n",
      "3. **Need for a Broader Search**: The current methods of navigation clearly have limitations, and I must find alternative routes to gather information regarding the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Steps to Consider\n",
      "1. **Keyword Retrieval**: Look for any relevant keywords in the content that might hint at broader historical contexts or academic discussions tied to Southeast Asia, resistance movements, or World War II.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Broaden Topic Focus**: Instead of relying on links, consider if there are overarching themes in governance or conflicts that could relate to resistance movements historically. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Explore Alternative Historical Resources**: If there is an acknowledgment that the current content does not provide relevant links, I can consider searching for related topics on Wikipedia's broader categories, focusing on:\n",
      "   - Resistance movements in Southeast Asia during World War II,\n",
      "   - Thai history during the war, or\n",
      "   - International responses to the Empire of Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Conclude Current Navigation**: If these thoughts do not yield new leads, I should conclude the current navigation session, documenting the steps taken and the results encountered, as it is clear that further attempts are unlikely to deliver fruitful outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Immediate Action\n",
      "Since the previous retrievals of the current content have been uniform without new insights, I should emphasize concluding this session. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I still want to reattempt meaningful navigation or delve into a fresh topic elsewhere after this, I will articulate a search strategy referencing historical dimensions related to the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thus, my action now is to accept that I cannot navigate further from this page and to conclude this session effectively.**\n",
      "\n",
      "USER: Now, what action will you take based on your reasoning?\n",
      "\n",
      "Model response ('Action'): Given the analysis of my current situation and the realization that I cannot successfully navigate from the Blavatnik School of Government page to the Free Thai Movement, I will **conclude this navigation process**. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Actions Taken:\n",
      "1. **Repeated Attempts**: I have attempted to access various links in hopes of finding a pathway to the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "2. **Invalid Links**: Each attempt to follow a link has led to an invalid page, confirming that the current content does not provide valid connections to the desired topic.\n",
      "3. **No Relevant Content**: The themes and content accessed do not reference or connect to historical discussions around the Free Thai Movement, World War II, or relevant resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps for Future Reference:\n",
      "1. In future sessions, I will start from more relevant topics, such as specific pages focusing on World War II in Asia or specifically on Thailand’s history.\n",
      "2. Alternatively, I will explore categories within Wikipedia that focus on military, geopolitical contexts, and resistance efforts during wartime, which might yield more fruitful information related to the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "With the evidence collected and the lack of valid navigation paths, I recognize that further attempts on this specific page have reached a logical conclusion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, my final action is to **wrap up the exploration and end this session**, noting that a new start on different topics or resources may be essential for successfully uncovering information on the Free Thai Movement in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "USER: Think carefully about your current situation and what actions you want to take to get closer to Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model response ('Reason'): After thoroughly examining the circumstances surrounding my attempts to navigate from the Blavatnik School of Government page to the Free Thai Movement, it’s clear that I’m at a standstill. All paths taken have resulted in invalid links, and there is insufficient content relevant to the Free Thai Movement within the material I have accessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Current Situation Recap:\n",
      "- **Repeated Failures**: Attempts to follow any links from the current page have consistently led to dead ends.\n",
      "- **No Relevant References**: The current content does not contain historical references or discussions pertinent to the Free Thai Movement or its context in World War II.\n",
      "- **Stalemate**: I cannot find a way forward from this page in my quest to access information about the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Detailed Action Plan:\n",
      "Given this situation, my subsequent steps should focus on how to pivot effectively:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accept Current Limitations**: Acknowledge that I cannot navigate to the Free Thai Movement from the current content and allow myself to accept this fact without further attempts from this location.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Explore New Pathways Independently**: \n",
      "   - Ideally, I would transition to a search for broader subjects or relevant historical contexts related to resistance movements in Southeast Asia or World War II from a fresh starting point, such as:\n",
      "     - Searching for \"Thailand during World War II\" or \"Southeast Asian resistance movements\" directly on Wikipedia.\n",
      "     - Looking for pages that discuss resistance movements against occupying forces during this period.\n",
      "  \n",
      "3. **Documentation of Efforts**: I will document what I learned during this navigation effort. This can help guide future attempts by referring to effective keyword searches or headers that align with my goal of learning about the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Plan Future Sessions**: Consider planning additional sessions that focus specifically on historical, military, and political content surrounding World War II and Southeast Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Immediate Action:\n",
      "As all attempts from the Blavatnik School of Government have proven unfruitful, the action I will take now is to clearly **conclude this session** and summarize the approach I took while noting that I will be seeking alternative paths in future inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, I recognize the need to stop further navigation attempts and prepare to redirect my efforts for more successful outcomes from different starting points in later sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "USER: Now, what action will you take based on your reasoning?\n",
      "\n",
      "Model response ('Action'): Given the situation where I have reached a conclusive dead end while trying to navigate from the Blavatnik School of Government page to the Free Thai Movement, the most prudent action is to **formally conclude this navigation session**. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Summary\n",
      "1. **Navigational Efforts**: I have thoroughly explored the available content and attempted to follow links that should have led to the Free Thai Movement, with each effort resulting in invalid pathways.\n",
      "2. **No Valid Connections**: There have been no references or accessible information related to the Free Thai Movement within the content of the Blavatnik School of Government.\n",
      "3. **Need for New Approach**: Acknowledge that a new search strategy is required, focusing on other topics or pages that delve into relevant historical contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps\n",
      "- In future inquiries, I plan to start from different, more relevant topics related to World War II, specifically seeking information on Southeast Asia or resistance movements.\n",
      "- I will also document the outcome of this session to inform my future research strategies, leveraging the knowledge gained from this experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "With all avenues explored from the current page proving unfruitful, I am formally concluding this interaction. I will take note of this learning experience as I move forward to new sessions aimed at uncovering information about the Free Thai Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This decision reflects a comprehensive understanding of the limitations within this session and prepares me for more productive endeavors going forward. Thank you for your engagement in this exploration.\n",

    "The [reflexion paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366) proposes a method that improves performance by getting LLMs to do self-reflection. The original paper looks at LLM agents in a RL set-up, where getting a reward signal on the agent's signal is slow and expensive. The key idea is to get **quick cheap feedback** from an evaluator on every proposed action, then to **reflect** on this feedback before taking the next action, as opposed to waiting for the final outcome. In their case, the evaluator was a heuristic function that estimated the reward function. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will borrow and modify this idea by building a tool that allows our agent to perform a lookahead, and then gives feedback on our agent's proposed actions. We allow the agent to suggest candidate paths, then the tool will check if these paths work and inform the model either that the path works, or where the path goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want to provide the agent the links or content of every page when it does this lookahead, as then we'd just be reimplementing a smaller version of the game *inside the game*. Instead, we'll let the agent suggest paths without seeing any content or links, and then let it know if this path works. It's very likely that a suggested link will — at some point — not be accessible from one of the pages, but this tool will still be useful to help the agent plan."

Alternatively, if you're feeling particularly ambitious, you can try and come up with your own more difficult task and build an agent to try and accomplish this from scratch."
